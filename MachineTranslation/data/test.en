28@@ -@@ Year@@ -@@ Old Ch@@ ef Found De@@ ad at San Francisco Mall
a 28@@ -@@ year-@@ old che@@ f who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stair@@ well of a local m@@ all this wee@@ k.
but the vic@@ tim@@ 's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hur@@ t him, saying, "@@ Things were finally going well for him@@ ."
the body found at the West@@ field Mall W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day morning was identified as 28@@ -@@ year-@@ old San Francisco re@@ sident Fr@@ ank Gal@@ ici@@ a, the San Francisco Medical Ex@@ amin@@ er's Office said.
the San Francisco Pol@@ ice Department said the death was rul@@ ed a hom@@ ic@@ ide and an investig@@ ation is on@@ go@@ ing.
the vic@@ tim@@ 's bro@@ ther, Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a, told AB@@ C station K@@ G@@ O in San Francisco that Fran@@ k, previously a line c@@ ook in Bo@@ st@@ on, had land@@ ed his dream job as line che@@ f at San Franc@@ is@@ co@@ 's S@@ ons & D@@ augh@@ ters restaurant six months ag@@ o.
a spo@@ k@@ es@@ person for S@@ ons & D@@ augh@@ ters said they were "@@ shoc@@ ked and dev@@ ast@@ ated@@ " by his death@@ .
"@@ we are a small team that oper@@ ates like a close k@@ n@@ it family and he will be de@@ arly mis@@ s@@ ed@@ ," the spo@@ k@@ es@@ person said.
our thou@@ ghts and con@@ dol@@ ences are with Frank@@ 's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a said Fr@@ ank initi@@ ally stayed in hostel@@ s, but rec@@ ently, "@@ Things were finally going well for him@@ ."

Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a said he could not think of anyone who would want to hur@@ t his youn@@ ger bro@@ ther.
he was a kind spirit with a big hear@@ t.
his way of connecting with the family was always making us a dis@@ h, making us din@@ ner, "@@ Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a said.
he never wanted to be in any kind of al@@ ter@@ c@@ ation.
he was the brother that went with the flow@@ .
"@@ with everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the rou@@ gh that was sh@@ ining bright every day@@ ," he said.

j@@ uni@@ or doc@@ tors stri@@ ke@@ : calls for fresh industrial action
representatives of j@@ uni@@ or doc@@ tors have called on their union to author@@ ise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contrac@@ t.
the J@@ uni@@ or Doc@@ tors Committee (@@ J@@ D@@ C) of the British Medical Association (B@@ MA@@ ) is to ask its full coun@@ cil to back more industrial action from early Septem@@ ber.
the J@@ DC says minist@@ ers have fail@@ ed to address concer@@ ns about the contrac@@ t.
j@@ uni@@ or doc@@ tors and medical students vo@@ ted in July to re@@ ject a contract deal agreed with the B@@ MA@@ .
it was rejec@@ ted by 58@@ % of its members who vo@@ ted in the bal@@ lo@@ t.
in a letter to members released on Twitter on Th@@ urs@@ day night, the J@@ D@@ C@@ 's chair El@@ len Mc@@ Court said the government had remained "@@ per@@ s@@ isten@@ tly sil@@ ent@@ " on issues wh@@ ich, she said, had resul@@ ted in the contract being rejec@@ ted.
she said: "@@ in light of this, the J@@ DC Executive has vo@@ ted to re@@ ject the proposed new contract in full and to call for form@@ al re-@@ negoti@@ ations on all of your concer@@ n@@ s."
in response to the govern@@ ment@@ 's sil@@ ence, J@@ DC ex@@ e@@ c has today made a form@@ al request for a special meeting of B@@ MA Council to author@@ ise a roll@@ ing programme of es@@ cal@@ ated industrial action beginning in early Septem@@ ber.
the dispute has led to j@@ uni@@ or doc@@ tors taking part in six stri@@ kes this year, including the first all-@@ out stop@@ pages in the history of the N@@ H@@ S.
the B@@ MA@@ 's j@@ uni@@ or doc@@ tor lead@@ er, Dr Joh@@ an@@ n Mal@@ aw@@ ana, re@@ signed following the vote to re@@ ject the negoti@@ ated terms of the contrac@@ t, which the B@@ MA had recommend@@ ed.
he had told B@@ MA members the deal was a good one that should be accep@@ ted, during meet@@ ings ahead of the pol@@ l of 54@@ ,000 j@@ uni@@ or doc@@ tors and medical stud@@ ents.
following the vo@@ te, Health Secretary Jer@@ em@@ y Hun@@ t said the contract would be im@@ posed on med@@ ics in Eng@@ land.
Russia and Tur@@ ke@@ y: an '@@ alli@@ ance of mis@@ fit@@ s@@ '@@ ?
it was a g@@ est@@ ure that ended a cris@@ is.
the leaders of Russia and Tur@@ key met on Tu@@ es@@ day to sha@@ ke hands and decl@@ are a form@@ al end to an eigh@@ t-@@ month long war of words and economic sanc@@ tions.
bu@@ t, as V@@ la@@ di@@ m@@ ir P@@ uti@@ n gre@@ e@@ ted his Turk@@ ish counter@@ part in the g@@ ild@@ ed hall of a St. Peters@@ burg pal@@ ace, I got the distinc@@ t impres@@ sion that An@@ k@@ ara wants this re@@ conc@@ ili@@ ation the mo@@ st.
there was the hand@@ sha@@ ke, y@@ es.
but Mr P@@ ut@@ in@@ 's sm@@ ile looked thin and he was hard@@ ly oo@@ zing warm@@ th even by his own re@@ str@@ ained standards.
Rec@@ ep T@@ ay@@ y@@ ip Er@@ do@@ g@@ an by contr@@ ast tal@@ ked repe@@ ated@@ ly of his "@@ de@@ ar friend@@ " Mr P@@ uti@@ n - five times, according to one re@@ port.
I lost coun@@ t.
he also ple@@ dg@@ ed that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-@@ cris@@ is level, but even high@@ er.
the next day one newspap@@ er here described Mr Er@@ do@@ g@@ an as acting as if nothing bad had ever happen@@ ed.
to me, his enthusi@@ as@@ m implied the op@@ po@@ site.
but a ling@@ ering cool@@ ness em@@ an@@ ating from Mr P@@ uti@@ n showed that Russi@@ a's leader has for@@ gotten no@@ thing.
in fact, the cause of the cris@@ is was the first thing he mentioned in his opening com@@ ments: Tur@@ ke@@ y's sho@@ o@@ ting down of a Russian fi@@ gh@@ ter plane on the Syri@@ an b@@ ord@@ er.
Mo@@ sc@@ ow@@ 's re@@ action at the time was fur@@ i@@ ous.
Mr P@@ uti@@ n l@@ ash@@ ed out, acc@@ using An@@ k@@ ara of st@@ ab@@ bing Moscow in the back.
the off@@ ence was even great@@ er, coming from a sup@@ posed friend@@ .
re@@ building real trust will be hard@@ , perhaps im@@ possible.
Russian public opinion has also turned since Nov@@ emb@@ er.
for months, state-@@ controlled media conducted a st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing, all-@@ out off@@ ensive against An@@ kar@@ a.
all of a sud@@ d@@ en, it seemed like Tur@@ ks were to bl@@ ame for every@@ thing.
most serious were acc@@ us@@ ations from top offici@@ als that Mr Er@@ do@@ gan@@ 's own family has pro@@ fi@@ ted from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Sy@@ ria controlled by the so@@ -@@ called Islam@@ ic State@@ .
he's d@@ eni@@ ed that em@@ ph@@ ati@@ call@@ y.
but in St. Peters@@ burg came the official message that it's time to move on.
after all, this meeting only happened because Mr P@@ uti@@ n got the ap@@ ology he dem@@ anded from President Er@@ do@@ gan@@ .
Russia could claim a vic@@ tory of sor@@ ts.
for An@@ k@@ ara the benefits of calling a truc@@ e are cle@@ ar.
first and fore@@ mo@@ st, Er@@ do@@ g@@ an needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ous@@ ted from power last month in a fail@@ ed cou@@ p.
repe@@ at ter@@ ror attacks on Tur@@ key have clearly sha@@ ken him too.
there is also an economic mo@@ tive.
Russian sanc@@ tions have hit hard - particularly the ban on char@@ ter f@@ ligh@@ ts, which usually carry several million Russian tou@@ rists to the Turk@@ ish co@@ ast each year.
the number has sl@@ um@@ ped by almost 90@@ %.
as for Russi@@ a, tour operators and char@@ ter companies here will certainly be reli@@ ev@@ ed when flights event@@ ually res@@ um@@ e.
they're ban@@ king on a l@@ ate@@ -@@ season r@@ ush to the Mediterrane@@ an.
and even this wee@@ k, state TV has been predic@@ ting cheaper fruit and veget@@ ables once Turk@@ ish agricul@@ tural im@@ ports are permitted again.
"@@ tou@@ rists that way, tom@@ ato@@ es back here@@ ," as a report in V@@ ed@@ emo@@ st@@ i newspap@@ er ph@@ r@@ ased it.
but the visit also had additional political value for Mo@@ sc@@ ow@@ .
An@@ k@@ ara is ang@@ ry with the West for what it con@@ sid@@ ers a we@@ ak response to the attemp@@ ted ta@@ ke@@ over@@ .
add to that its long-@@ standing gr@@ ud@@ ge at the sn@@ ail@@ 's p@@ ace of tal@@ ks to join the EU and step in Mr P@@ uti@@ n - who is ke@@ en to capital@@ ise on the ch@@ ill and chip away at Tur@@ ke@@ y's ties with the W@@ est.
the Russian leader certainly won bon@@ us points with An@@ k@@ ara for calling in support of the elec@@ ted authorities after the attemp@@ ted cou@@ p.
mind you, that's a given for Moscow which has its own deep@@ -@@ se@@ ated fear of regim@@ e change.
so the sum@@ mit at this gl@@ it@@ z@@ y, seas@@ ide pal@@ ace allowed Russia and Tur@@ key to present what one analy@@ st described to me as an "@@ alli@@ ance of mis@@ fit@@ s@@ "@@ : two countries that feel rejec@@ ted and mist@@ re@@ ated by the W@@ est, jo@@ ining forc@@ es.
sti@@ ll@@ , despite the public display of re@@ conc@@ ili@@ ation, the two still have major differ@@ ences.
the key one is Syri@@ a, where Moscow has recently been casting itself as peace@@ maker but where Russia and Tur@@ key back opposite sid@@ es.
it could be telling that after almost three hours of initial tal@@ ks, the two presid@@ ents told a press conference that they h@@ ad@@ n't even touched on the top@@ ic.
Tur@@ ke@@ y's president deli@@ ber@@ ately avo@@ id@@ ed answ@@ ering a question on their differ@@ ences, while Mr P@@ uti@@ n cho@@ se to under@@ line them.
there is no clear cons@@ ensu@@ s on where they can seek common ground on Syri@@ a.
but after months of open ho@@ sti@@ lity - and given the potential for ut@@ ter dis@@ aster when N@@ a@@ to member Tur@@ key shot down that Russian fi@@ gh@@ ter j@@ et - it is su@@ rely better that the two leaders are at least talking again.
Royal Bank of Scot@@ land to dis@@ appear for customers outside Scot@@ land
the brand R@@ B@@ S is to be reduced to a back office ro@@ le, according to the bank@@ 's chief execu@@ tive.
Royal Bank of Scot@@ land will dis@@ appear for customers outside Scot@@ land.
Ro@@ ss Mc@@ E@@ w@@ an told B@@ BC Scot@@ land that the R@@ B@@ S brand was associated with the bank@@ 's global ambi@@ tions.
it has re@@ treated from them since it nearly coll@@ ap@@ sed eight years ago and had to be b@@ ail@@ ed out.
during that time, brand strategi@@ sts have used '@@ R@@ BS@@ ' to protect other consumer fin@@ ance brand@@ s.
it was back@@ ed with millions of p@@ ounds in spon@@ sor@@ ship of international s@@ port, from Si@@ x Nations ru@@ g@@ by to W@@ im@@ ble@@ d@@ on champ@@ ion An@@ dy M@@ ur@@ r@@ ay.
but now, it has been judg@@ ed right to let more national brands come to the fore@@ .
Royal Bank of Scot@@ land will be used with Scot@@ tish customers, but will not be initi@@ al@@ is@@ ed.
in England and Wal@@ es, all R@@ B@@ S refer@@ ences, outside head office and the stock exchange list@@ ing, will be changed to Nat@@ W@@ est.
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Irel@@ and.
there are other, smaller brands for private bank@@ ing, which will get more pro@@ min@@ ence - C@@ out@@ ts, Ad@@ am & Co@@ , Dr@@ um@@ mon@@ d, and Hol@@ t's Mil@@ itary Ban@@ k.
Mr Mc@@ E@@ w@@ an was inter@@ viewed during a tour of customers and staff in In@@ vern@@ ess@@ -@@ shi@@ re.
he told B@@ BC Scot@@ land@@ : "the R@@ B@@ S brand will end up becoming our invest@@ or brand and the one that our staff are emplo@@ yed with, because we are now becoming much more a bank of brand@@ s."
as the bank itself became a global br@@ and, R@@ B@@ S became the global brand@@ .
I'm now saying we no longer have global asp@@ ir@@ ations, we have local asp@@ ir@@ ations.
each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own comm@@ uni@@ ties, and our staff will work with customers under those brand@@ s.
R@@ B@@ S had already stated that it would not to continue its Si@@ x Nations spon@@ sor@@ ship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports spon@@ sor@@ ship.
"the time is right for us to move to the bank of brand@@ s, because under@@ ne@@ ath (@@ we@@ 've been ask@@ ing) how do we focus on making this a better bank for custom@@ ers@@ ?" said the chief execu@@ tive.
it would have been very cy@@ nical three years ago if we@@ 'd said we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there.
but with the work we@@ 've been do@@ ing, foc@@ us@@ sing on the customers need@@ s, not our own@@ , I think you're seeing a lot of change.
we can bring those brands back up again, so I think the time is right.

Fran@@ ki@@ e is one of the best j@@ oc@@ keys of the modern era and it is no sur@@ prise he has reached this land@@ mark so few have achieved before him.
he is sty@@ lish and str@@ ong, but it is his tac@@ tical n@@ ous that sets him apart from others in the weigh@@ ing room.
he is a fant@@ astic am@@ bass@@ ador for rac@@ ing, his enthusi@@ as@@ m and char@@ is@@ ma have been drawing f@@ ans to the s@@ port for years.
I said to Fran@@ ki@@ e a few weeks ago at Ep@@ so@@ m he@@ 'd have rid@@ den 6@@ ,000 win@@ ners if he wasn't just a week@@ end and big@@ -@@ race j@@ oc@@ key@@ !
seri@@ ously though@@ , Fran@@ ki@@ e's been ri@@ ding win@@ ners in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is great to se@@ e.
he's a li@@ vely character which is good for British r@@ acing but more than that, he's an incredi@@ ble j@@ oc@@ ke@@ y.

three years ago he initi@@ ally stru@@ gg@@ led when retur@@ ning from that six@@ -@@ month suspen@@ sion, but he showed form@@ id@@ able strength of character to de@@ fy the dou@@ b@@ ters and return to his b@@ est.

Russi@@ a's P@@ uti@@ n s@@ acks chief of staff Ser@@ ge@@ i I@@ v@@ ano@@ v
Russian President V@@ la@@ di@@ m@@ ir P@@ uti@@ n has un@@ exp@@ ec@@ ted@@ ly dis@@ mis@@ sed his chief of staff Ser@@ ge@@ i I@@ van@@ ov@@ .
Mr I@@ v@@ ano@@ v has been part of Mr P@@ ut@@ in@@ 's tr@@ usted inner circ@@ le for many years.
the 6@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issu@@ es.
a statement from the K@@ rem@@ lin said that Mr P@@ uti@@ n had "@@ decre@@ ed to reli@@ eve I@@ v@@ ano@@ v of his du@@ ties as head of the Russian presid@@ ential administr@@ ation@@ ," but gave no reas@@ on.
Mr I@@ van@@ ov@@ 's dep@@ uty since 201@@ 2, An@@ ton V@@ ain@@ o, has been appointed as his success@@ or.
Mr V@@ ain@@ o, 4@@ 4, is a former diplom@@ at.
born in the Est@@ onian capital T@@ all@@ in@@ n in 197@@ 2, he gradu@@ ated from the prestigi@@ ous Moscow State Institute of International Rel@@ ations (M@@ G@@ IM@@ O@@ ) and served in the Tokyo emb@@ ass@@ y.
later he managed presid@@ ential proto@@ col and government staff@@ , the K@@ rem@@ lin website says (in Russi@@ an@@ ).
on being appoin@@ ted, he told Mr P@@ ut@@ in: "@@ thank you for your tr@@ ust@@ ."
I think the administr@@ ation@@ 's most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of dra@@ f@@ ting laws and control over how your instructions are imple@@ men@@ ted.
Mr P@@ uti@@ n told a Russian TV station on Fri@@ day that Mr I@@ v@@ ano@@ v had asked to leave the po@@ st, and recommended that Mr V@@ ain@@ o should replace him.
do the s@@ miles convinc@@ e?
this is a move that has my@@ sti@@ fied Mo@@ sc@@ ow@@ .
Ser@@ ge@@ i I@@ v@@ ano@@ v has long been one of V@@ la@@ di@@ m@@ ir P@@ ut@@ in@@ 's clos@@ est al@@ lies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the K@@ GB@@ .
as chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
in a meeting with President P@@ uti@@ n shown on state television both men claim@@ ed that the chief of staff was ste@@ pping down at his own request.
but despite the s@@ miles for the camer@@ as, few here are convinc@@ ed - especially now, just before par@@ li@@ am@@ ent@@ ary elec@@ tions.
so is this the f@@ all-@@ out from some kind of power stru@@ gg@@ le@@ ?
no@@ -@@ one knows y@@ et.
but the official claim - that a man once tou@@ ted as a potential presid@@ ent, suddenly wanted to run Russi@@ a's environmental policy - has been met with great sc@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism.
in re@@ marks to Mr P@@ ut@@ in, quo@@ ted on the K@@ rem@@ lin website, Mr I@@ v@@ ano@@ v said "@@ it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a convers@@ ation, to entr@@ ust me with this very com@@ plic@@ ated po@@ st, even - you could say - trou@@ bl@@ es@@ ome po@@ st, for four years.
well, it turns out that I've been presid@@ ential chief of staff for four years and eight month@@ s.
Mr I@@ v@@ ano@@ v took up the post in December 201@@ 1.
he served previously as a dep@@ uty pri@@ me min@@ ister and def@@ ence minist@@ er.
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the K@@ GB state security service, like Mr P@@ ut@@ in.
in the late 199@@ 0@@ s, when Mr P@@ uti@@ n was head of the Federal Security Service (@@ FS@@ B@@ ), which re@@ placed the K@@ G@@ B, Mr I@@ v@@ ano@@ v was appointed as his dep@@ ut@@ y.
when Mr P@@ uti@@ n came to power, he named Mr I@@ v@@ ano@@ v as one of the five people he tr@@ usted mo@@ st.
it was once thought that Mr I@@ v@@ ano@@ v might become president of Russia after Mr P@@ ut@@ in@@ 's second ter@@ m, as a third term for Mr P@@ uti@@ n would have been un@@ constitu@@ tion@@ al.
but that post was taken by another close P@@ uti@@ n ally, D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ v@@ ed@@ ev@@ .
Mr P@@ uti@@ n became pri@@ me minist@@ er, before retur@@ ning to the presid@@ ency just three-@@ and@@ -@@ a-@@ half years lat@@ er.

Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cro@@ ss@@ ing: bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £@@ 1.@@ 35@@ b@@ n project is now due to be complete by May 2017
engineers have joined the Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cro@@ ss@@ ing@@ 's north dec@@ k and vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ f@@ e.
it is the first of four clo@@ su@@ res between the "@@ dec@@ k f@@ ans@@ ," which are now ne@@ aring comple@@ tion around each of the bri@@ d@@ ge@@ 's three tow@@ ers.
the bridge section from Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weigh@@ s 30@@ ,000 ton@@ n@@ es.
it has 10@@ ,000 ton@@ n@@ es of steel and 20@@ ,000 ton@@ n@@ es of concrete and 46 stay@@ -@@ cab@@ les.
the £@@ 1.@@ 35@@ b@@ n project is now due to be complete by May 201@@ 7.
economy Secretary Ke@@ ith Brow@@ n visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridg@@ e.
he said: "@@ this is a historic and sy@@ mb@@ olic moment in the building of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cro@@ ss@@ ing.
we're all wit@@ ness@@ ing engineering on a truly ep@@ ic scale on this projec@@ t, with over 30@@ ,000 ton@@ n@@ es of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridg@@ e.
despite the mas@@ sive size and weight of the bridge comple@@ ting the clo@@ sure between the vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t and bridge dec@@ k is a del@@ ic@@ ate operation invol@@ ving extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit up.
over@@ all, nearly 7@@ 9@@ % of the total bridge dec@@ k is now in place, the final section of dec@@ k is having its concrete dec@@ k cast in Ro@@ sy@@ th to@@ day, meaning all the dec@@ k is ready to be lif@@ ted into place on the bridg@@ e.
Michael Mar@@ t@@ in, For@@ th Cro@@ ss@@ ing Bridge Construc@@ tors project director said: "the first clo@@ sure on any bridge project is always a significant mil@@ est@@ one.
on this fant@@ astic projec@@ t, this clo@@ sure represents leading edge civil engine@@ er@@ ing.
after install@@ ing the last road dec@@ k section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road dec@@ k, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or land@@ ward - side.
this was done by pul@@ ling the northern approach vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t 700 milli@@ metres sou@@ th@@ ward@@ s.
this was a mas@@ sive and, at the same time, very del@@ ic@@ ate oper@@ ation.

R@@ ais@@ man hu@@ gged her g@@ ently as they aw@@ ai@@ ted the final score - a mere form@@ ality - and te@@ ars appeared around B@@ il@@ es' gl@@ it@@ ter@@ y red, white and blue ey@@ elin@@ er when the vision she once wrote in a sc@@ rap@@ book became a real@@ ity.
R@@ ais@@ man@@ 's performance was a bit of re@@ ven@@ ge from four years ago, when she ti@@ ed for third but lost the br@@ on@@ ze to M@@ ust@@ af@@ ina on a ti@@ e@@ break@@ er.
this time, the 2@@ 2-@@ year-@@ old team cap@@ tain the Americ@@ ans call "@@ grand@@ ma@@ " was well a@@ head.
she ble@@ w kis@@ ses to the crow@@ d after her floor exerc@@ ise, over@@ come by a com@@ e@@ back that at times seemed in dou@@ b@@ t.
as for B@@ il@@ es, the 19@@ -@@ year-@@ old@@ 's vir@@ al t@@ we@@ et from earlier this week now car@@ ries a whole new mean@@ ing:
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brow@@ n, 6, "@@ rid@@ d@@ led with bul@@ let@@ s," survi@@ ves Phil@@ adel@@ p@@ hia sho@@ o@@ ting
police say a 6-@@ year-@@ old boy has been shot in Phil@@ adel@@ p@@ hi@@ a, mar@@ king the second sho@@ o@@ ting of a 6-@@ year-@@ old in the city this wee@@ k.
the child@@ 's grand@@ parents identified him to CB@@ S Phil@@ adel@@ p@@ hia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brow@@ n.
the grand@@ parents say Brow@@ n suffer@@ ed multiple gun@@ shot w@@ ound@@ s, including in his gro@@ in, leg@@ , arm and ab@@ dom@@ en, but was aw@@ ake when he was trans@@ ported to the hospit@@ al.
"@@ he just took a lo@@ t, his little body was rid@@ d@@ led with bul@@ let@@ s," his grand@@ mother Del@@ ore@@ s Mel@@ en@@ de@@ z tells the station.
I just can't believe it.
the boy is listed in critical condition at a hosp@@ ital and has under@@ gone several sur@@ g@@ eri@@ es.
family tells the station he is expected to reco@@ ver.
he was set to start first grade at a local ele@@ mentary scho@@ ol.
Brow@@ n was among four people shot in the German@@ town sec@@ tion.
also shot were three men@@ : two 29@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds and one 3@@ 2-@@ year ol@@ d.
one of the 29@@ -@@ year-@@ old men was reported in critical condition@@ ; the other two vic@@ tim@@ s were listed in stable condition@@ , according to CB@@ S Phil@@ adel@@ p@@ hi@@ a.
the child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29@@ -@@ year-@@ old in critical condition@@ , the station report@@ s.
the other two vic@@ tim@@ s were not in the car and police are investig@@ ating whether any of the w@@ ounded men could be a sho@@ o@@ ter.
investig@@ ators tells CB@@ S Phil@@ adel@@ p@@ hia it appears there was cross@@ fire between multiple gun@@ men.
ass@@ a@@ ult weap@@ on-@@ style sh@@ ell cas@@ ings, trac@@ ed to different ass@@ a@@ ult style weap@@ ons, lit@@ tered the scen@@ e.
it appears that this was definitely an on@@ going batt@@ le.
there were cas@@ ings in the stre@@ et, on both sides of the side@@ wal@@ k.
so it appears that there were multiple armed comb@@ at@@ ants out here and that they were actively eng@@ ag@@ ed, "@@ Phil@@ adel@@ p@@ hia police Cap@@ tain An@@ th@@ ony G@@ in@@ al@@ di told the station.
multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struc@@ k.
no ar@@ re@@ sts have been made and police are re@@ por@@ ted@@ ly review@@ ing surve@@ ill@@ ance vide@@ o.
another 6-@@ year-@@ old, a gir@@ l, was hit in her arm by a str@@ ay bul@@ let Tu@@ es@@ day while playing in front of her home in the West O@@ ak L@@ ane neighbor@@ hoo@@ d.
she is recover@@ ing, and police are still sear@@ ching for a susp@@ ec@@ t.
why we need Sim@@ one, G@@ ab@@ by and La@@ ur@@ ie
that's what I call this year@@ 's Women@@ 's Olympic G@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics Team and for more reasons than one.
first, I have been to every Summer Olymp@@ ics since 198@@ 4 and the USA has never been so domin@@ ant.
and second@@ : this team features three g@@ ym@@ n@@ ast@@ s, Sim@@ one B@@ il@@ es, G@@ ab@@ by Dou@@ gl@@ as and La@@ ure@@ n "@@ La@@ ur@@ i@@ e" Her@@ n@@ an@@ de@@ z, who have been in@@ spir@@ ing so many young girls of col@@ or.
the make@@ -up of this te@@ am, r@@ ounded out by A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man, who is Jew@@ ish, and Mad@@ ison Ko@@ ci@@ an, who is Cath@@ ol@@ ic, is making everyone pr@@ ou@@ d.
this team loo@@ ks, fin@@ ally, like Americ@@ a.
it also has sol@@ i@@ di@@ fied the black and Lat@@ ina female presence at the top of this s@@ port.
for the past four years, the number one female g@@ ym@@ n@@ ast has been Afric@@ an-@@ Americ@@ an.
last year, Sim@@ one and G@@ ab@@ by were # 1 and # 2.
this is power@@ ful.
last Olymp@@ ics, G@@ ab@@ by Dou@@ gl@@ as was a sur@@ prise Olympic champ@@ ion, and America che@@ er@@ ed.
now the world has been able to wit@@ ness the incredi@@ ble perform@@ ances of three-@@ time World Champ@@ ion Sim@@ one B@@ il@@ es, Dou@@ gl@@ as and La@@ ur@@ ie Her@@ n@@ an@@ de@@ z deliver@@ ing the un@@ exp@@ ec@@ ted, yet master@@ ful g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics rou@@ tin@@ es.
on Th@@ urs@@ day, Sim@@ one became the fourth straight American to win gold in the wom@@ en@@ 's individual all-@@ around event.
and team@@ mate A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man ear@@ ned sil@@ ver.
we are wit@@ ness@@ ing the top of the s@@ port, but it does not look like this at g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics classes across the country.
Sim@@ one, G@@ ab@@ by and La@@ ur@@ ie all took the same path as A@@ ly and Mad@@ ison to make the Olympic team@@ .
they are the "@@ Fin@@ al Fi@@ ve@@ " because the next Olympic g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics team will only have four g@@ ym@@ n@@ asts on the te@@ am, and this is Mar@@ ta Kar@@ ol@@ yi@@ 's last year co@@ ach@@ ing.
but the reality is that g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics is an expensive s@@ port, and g@@ ym@@ n@@ asts primarily train in private g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics club@@ s that are main@@ tained by parents paying the cost of the train@@ ing, facil@@ ity, trav@@ el, uni@@ form@@ s, competition fees, hotel fees (for the co@@ aches and their g@@ ym@@ n@@ asts and famili@@ es) and the list goes on.
most of these g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics club@@ s are located in aff@@ lu@@ ent sub@@ urban neighbor@@ hoo@@ ds that can support the business.
these club@@ s are where the g@@ ym@@ n@@ asts get all of their train@@ ing, and it's a cost@@ ly and long-term commitment for the g@@ ym@@ n@@ ast@@ s' famili@@ es.
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man, co@@ ach of Sim@@ one B@@ il@@ es, and Mag@@ gi@@ e Han@@ e@@ y, co@@ ach of La@@ ur@@ ie Her@@ n@@ an@@ de@@ z, have both co@@ ached their ath@@ le@@ tes since they started in g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics.
we must bring more affordable and accessible g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics training to the communities of coun@@ t@@ less young girls who are inspired by Sim@@ one, G@@ ab@@ by and La@@ ur@@ i@@ e.
I founded my g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics foundation 20 years ag@@ o.
at my organiz@@ ations, we have provided free and low-@@ cost g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics, based in Har@@ le@@ m, for over 15@@ ,000 urban youth (@@ primarily black and H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic@@ ) and have train@@ ed national and international champ@@ ion@@ s.
in Septem@@ ber, we will be expanding to Det@@ ro@@ it (@@ my hom@@ et@@ own@@ ) to provide high quality g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics to the youth that des@@ erve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic s@@ port.
g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics develop@@ s streng@@ th, flexibility and co@@ ord@@ ination for the body and hard work, discipl@@ ine and determin@@ ation for the min@@ d.
this combination provides life@@ -@@ long benefits for good heal@@ th, success in school and work.
it is the in@@ spir@@ ation of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics and that is gre@@ at.
to participate in s@@ port is so import@@ ant, especially for girl@@ s.
this is such an exc@@ iting time.
thank you Sim@@ one, Al@@ y, La@@ ur@@ i@@ e, G@@ ab@@ by and Mad@@ ison for that serious show@@ case of "@@ Girl Power@@ " in winning the Olympic team gold and for mo@@ tiv@@ ating so many young girls of all back@@ grounds to begin their path to be health@@ y, strong and successful young wom@@ en.
j@@ uni@@ or doc@@ tors set to m@@ ount further stri@@ kes after rejec@@ ting Jer@@ em@@ y Hun@@ t's propos@@ al
Min@@ ist@@ ers had ho@@ ped to end the dispute over the changes by agre@@ eing to a re@@ formed contract with British Medical Association offici@@ als, but 58 per cent of the 37@@ ,000 j@@ uni@@ or doc@@ tors who took part in a bal@@ lot had rejec@@ ted it.
in J@@ ul@@ y, Mr Hun@@ t reve@@ aled plans to im@@ pose the contract saying the N@@ H@@ S was in "@@ no man@@ 's land@@ " and any further delay would be dam@@ aging for staff and pati@@ ents.
the first j@@ uni@@ or doc@@ tors are moved onto the new contrac@@ t, which includes changes to over@@ night and week@@ end working practices to improve care at un@@ soci@@ able hour@@ s.
Dr El@@ len Mc@@ Cour@@ t, the B@@ MA@@ 's j@@ uni@@ or doc@@ tors "@@ commit@@ tee ch@@ air, said in a statement last night@@ :@@ " j@@ uni@@ or doc@@ tors still have serious concer@@ ns about the proposed contrac@@ t, particularly that it will fuel the current work@@ force cris@@ is, and that it fails to treat all doc@@ tors fair@@ ly. "
with just eight weeks before the first group of doc@@ tors are moved onto the new contrac@@ t, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
efforts by the B@@ MA to resol@@ ve the dispute through tal@@ ks have been met with an un@@ will@@ ing@@ ness to engage and, at times, de@@ af@@ ening sil@@ ence from the govern@@ ment.
this is despite a promise from Jer@@ em@@ y Hun@@ t just last month that his door is always open@@ .
"@@ Jer@@ em@@ y Hun@@ t needs to act now, lift the im@@ position and address j@@ uni@@ or doc@@ tor@@ s" concer@@ n@@ s.
if he does not then j@@ uni@@ or doc@@ tors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action.
the last stri@@ ke at the end of April saw the post@@ pon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 rou@@ t@@ ine operations and 100@@ ,000 appoint@@ ments as nur@@ ses and consult@@ ants were dra@@ f@@ ted in to provide cover for doc@@ tors on the pic@@ ket line.
Min@@ ist@@ ers had ho@@ ped to end the dispute over the changes by agre@@ eing to a re@@ formed contract with British Medical Association offici@@ als.
the B@@ MA wants better week@@ end pay for the 54@@ ,000 j@@ uni@@ or doc@@ tors who would be subject of the contrac@@ t.
Dani@@ el Mor@@ tim@@ er, chief executive of N@@ H@@ S Emp@@ loy@@ ers, called on j@@ uni@@ or doc@@ tors not to go ahead with any stri@@ k@@ es.
Mr Mor@@ tim@@ er said: "@@ industrial action achiev@@ es little or no@@ thing, but places pressure on already stret@@ ched teams and services and causes wor@@ ry, dist@@ ress and dis@@ rup@@ tion for pati@@ ents, car@@ ers and their famili@@ es."
over the last two months we have been talking with the J@@ uni@@ or Doc@@ tors Committee and ha@@ ve, along with the Department of Health and others, responded posi@@ tively to their concer@@ ns regarding the Gu@@ ardi@@ an R@@ ole and wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ low@@ ing.
employ@@ ers were ho@@ pe@@ ful that the continued positive eng@@ agement on other important top@@ ics - such as dep@@ loy@@ ment, flexibility in train@@ ing, additional training for those retur@@ ning from career break@@ s, costs of train@@ ing, mutual recognition of sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us, study leave and the g@@ ender pay gap in medic@@ ine - were a sign of how serious employ@@ ers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about hon@@ our@@ ing the agre@@ ements reached with the B@@ MA in Nov@@ emb@@ er, February and M@@ ay.
the £@@ 2-@@ a-@@ day drug that can cut heart attack thre@@ at
thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £@@ 2-@@ a-@@ day dru@@ g, after offici@@ als recommended it be given to more people for long@@ er.
anti-@@ clo@@ t@@ ting drug tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or sl@@ ash@@ es the risk of repe@@ at attacks for people with heart diseas@@ e.
the drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack@@ , reducing the risk of a stro@@ ke or another attack@@ .
N@@ H@@ S watch@@ do@@ g N@@ IC@@ E has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of car@@ di@@ ov@@ asc@@ ular proble@@ ms.
but now N@@ H@@ S watch@@ do@@ g N@@ IC@@ E has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of car@@ di@@ ov@@ asc@@ ular proble@@ ms.
some 140@@ ,000 people have a heart attack in England every year, and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stro@@ ke.
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by the build@@ -up of f@@ at@@ ty material in ar@@ ter@@ y walls to form a pl@@ a@@ qu@@ e.
if the pl@@ a@@ que break@@ s apart it can cause a blood clo@@ t, bloc@@ king blood to the heart ca@@ using a heart attack@@ .
and if the clo@@ t dis@@ lodg@@ es it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the bra@@ in, ca@@ using a stro@@ ke.
people who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having an@@ other.
tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or, which is made by UK firm A@@ stra@@ Z@@ en@@ ec@@ a and sold under the trade name Br@@ ili@@ qu@@ e, reduces this risk by making clo@@ ts less lik@@ el@@ y.
the dra@@ ft N@@ IC@@ E guid@@ ance, published to@@ day, recommen@@ ds that people be given 90 m@@ g of tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or for 12 months, followed by 60@@ m@@ g along with asp@@ ir@@ in twice a day for another three years.
Prof@@ essor Car@@ ole Long@@ son, director at the N@@ IC@@ E health technology evalu@@ ation centre, said: "@@ despite the availability of effective second@@ ary pre@@ vention treat@@ ments, as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stro@@ ke - often with dev@@ ast@@ ating consequ@@ enc@@ es."
fear of a rec@@ ur@@ ren@@ ce can have a significant negative impact on a person@@ 's quality of life.
the evidence shows that tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or, in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in, is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who have already had a heart attack@@ .
in provision@@ ally recommen@@ ding tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it.
because information on the eff@@ ic@@ acy and safety of tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - particularly the risk of ble@@ eding - beyond three years is limi@@ ted, the dra@@ ft guid@@ ance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that perio@@ d.
PC culture let vote fra@@ u@@ d in Musli@@ m areas fl@@ our@@ ish
ex@@ -@@ Tower Ham@@ lets may@@ or L@@ ut@@ fu@@ r R@@ ah@@ man was removed from office last year for corrup@@ tion, promp@@ ting the government report
a culture of political correc@@ t@@ ness has led to a b@@ lin@@ d eye being turned to wid@@ es@@ pre@@ ad vo@@ ting fra@@ u@@ d in Musli@@ m comm@@ uni@@ ties, a dev@@ ast@@ ating government report reve@@ als today.
ex@@ -@@ Cab@@ inet min@@ ister S@@ ir E@@ ric P@@ ick@@ les lam@@ b@@ asts the polic@@ e, election watch@@ do@@ gs and town h@@ alls for ign@@ oring evidence of elec@@ tor@@ al ab@@ use because of "@@ over@@ -@@ sensi@@ ti@@ vi@@ ties about eth@@ nic@@ ity and religi@@ on@@ ."
the former communities secre@@ tar@@ y, now the anti-@@ corrup@@ tion ts@@ ar, said the in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation of vo@@ ters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put c@@ ord@@ ons outside pol@@ ling stations to protect f@@ righ@@ ten@@ ed vo@@ ters.
he recommen@@ ds that vo@@ ters should have to take ID to prove who they are when they vo@@ te.
curren@@ t@@ ly, a vo@@ ter merely has to state their name and addres@@ s.
the report even sugg@@ ests putting ind@@ eli@@ ble ink on a person@@ 's fingers as they cast their bal@@ lot to prevent anyone being able to vote tw@@ ice.
greater protection should be given to wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ low@@ ers, S@@ ir E@@ ric say@@ s.
he calls for the Press to be given greater access to coun@@ cil papers and decis@@ ions taken by u@@ no@@ ff@@ icial commit@@ te@@ es or working grou@@ ps.
"@@ this is not solely to protect against elec@@ tor@@ al fra@@ ud@@ , but to protect local government from the broad@@ er culture of corrup@@ tion and financial fra@@ u@@ d that goes hand in hand with it@@ ," he said.
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street in the wa@@ ke of the Tower Ham@@ lets vo@@ ting sc@@ and@@ al in East London@@ .
last year a special election court rul@@ ed the sitting may@@ or, L@@ ut@@ fu@@ r R@@ ah@@ man, should be removed from office following a lit@@ any of corrup@@ t and illegal practic@@ es.
the court found R@@ ah@@ man "@@ cy@@ n@@ ically per@@ ver@@ ted@@ " the religious feeling of his Musli@@ m community and sil@@ enc@@ ed his cri@@ tics with acc@@ us@@ ations of rac@@ ism and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ a.
R@@ ah@@ man, it was said, "@@ ran his campa@@ ign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faith@@ ful Musli@@ ms to vote for him@@ ."
up to 300 vo@@ tes were d@@ ub@@ ious or the result of person@@ ation, where a person vo@@ tes while pos@@ ing as someone el@@ se.
si@@ r E@@ ric said there was evidence of fra@@ u@@ d across the country.
he vo@@ ic@@ ed particular al@@ arm about post@@ al vo@@ ting fra@@ u@@ d - in which senior members of the Musli@@ m community were said to have ex@@ er@@ ted pressure on people to vote for a can@@ di@@ date of their choo@@ s@@ ing.
si@@ r E@@ ric@@ , pic@@ ture@@ d, made several recommendations to clean up the vo@@ ting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are
his report say@@ s: "@@ evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulner@@ able members of some eth@@ nic min@@ ority comm@@ uni@@ ties, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the el@@ der@@ s, especially in communities of Pak@@ ist@@ ani and Bang@@ lad@@ esh@@ i back@@ ground.
"@@ there were concer@@ ns that@@ ... state institutions had turned a b@@ lin@@ d eye to such behavi@@ our because of@@ " poli@@ tically correct "@@ over@@ -@@ sensi@@ ti@@ vi@@ ties about eth@@ nic@@ ity and religi@@ on@@ ."
si@@ r E@@ ric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including ban@@ ning political activi@@ sts from handling post@@ al bal@@ lot papers to stop "@@ vote har@@ v@@ est@@ ing@@ ."
the re@@ port, being considered by Ther@@ es@@ a M@@ ay, also calls for tou@@ gh@@ er chec@@ ks on registration to prevent the elec@@ tor@@ al register being used for im@@ migration and benefit fra@@ ud@@ .
consider the options for requ@@ iring vo@@ ters to produce ID before vo@@ t@@ ing.
use ind@@ eli@@ ble ink on a person@@ 's fingers once they cast their bal@@ lot to prevent anyone vo@@ ting tw@@ ice.
carry out system@@ atic chec@@ ks on a person@@ 's nation@@ ality to ensure they are elig@@ ible to vo@@ te.
put a three-@@ year limit on requests for an automatic post@@ al vo@@ te.
ban political campaign@@ ers and activi@@ sts from handling completed post@@ al vo@@ tes and post@@ al vote en@@ vel@@ op@@ es.
give police pow@@ ers to set up c@@ ord@@ ons around pol@@ ling st@@ ations.
change the law to make it easier to charge people with in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation under the Represent@@ ation of the People Act 198@@ 3.
make it illegal to take pictures in pol@@ ling st@@ ations.
make it a require@@ ment that only English is to be used in pol@@ ling stations (@@ except in Wal@@ es@@ ).
strengthen training to ensure staff en@@ force the rule that vo@@ ters go to the boo@@ th al@@ one.
si@@ r E@@ ric sav@@ ages the Met@@ ropol@@ itan Pol@@ ice, saying it is "@@ ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing@@ " that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Ham@@ lets case.
"the election court dis@@ qualified L@@ ut@@ fu@@ r R@@ ah@@ man and his agent for a lit@@ any of corrup@@ t and illegal practic@@ es@@ ," he said.
he was found gu@@ il@@ ty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of ground@@ s.
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effec@@ tual "@@ tic@@ k-@@ box inspec@@ tion@@ s" of town hall elec@@ tor@@ al registration depart@@ ments.
si@@ r E@@ ric said: "@@ last year@@ 's court rul@@ ing in Tower Ham@@ lets was a w@@ ak@@ e-up call@@ .

how to defend yourself from gun attacks using K@@ ra@@ v Mag@@ a
it's a dang@@ erous world out there, but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com might help make it a little saf@@ er for you.
we spoke to R@@ h@@ on M@@ iz@@ r@@ achi@@ , New Yor@@ k-@@ based grand@@ master of the K@@ ra@@ v Mag@@ a Fed@@ er@@ ation, to find out how to deal with gun@@ -@@ to@@ ting mu@@ gg@@ ers at close rang@@ e.
whether you're appro@@ ached from in front or beh@@ ind@@ , this video will show you how to turn the tab@@ les on your mu@@ gg@@ er.
if appro@@ ached from beh@@ ind@@ , M@@ iz@@ r@@ ach@@ i say@@ s, the first thing to do is turn ar@@ ound, so that you can see your attack@@ er and '@@ clear the line of fire@@ '@@ .
you then gr@@ asp the gun between your fore@@ arm and shoul@@ der before h@@ itting them in the face with your free el@@ bow@@ .
a kne@@ e to the gro@@ in follow@@ s, and while the attack@@ er dou@@ bl@@ es up in p@@ ain, you tw@@ ist the gun from his hands, sm@@ ack him in the face with the bar@@ re@@ l and back up, keeping the weap@@ on train@@ ed on him.
for gun@@ men appro@@ aching from the fron@@ t, it's a similar techni@@ que - get your body out of the line of fi@@ re, gr@@ ab the gun and tw@@ ist it around so the vil@@ la@@ in can't fi@@ re.
at the same time, put weight on the gun and pun@@ ch the attack@@ er in the ch@@ est, then tw@@ ist the gun from his gri@@ p before b@@ acking up and poin@@ ting it at him.
s@@ ounds tr@@ ick@@ y?
check the video to see exactly how M@@ iz@@ r@@ ach@@ i does it.
but remember that the saf@@ est way out of any mu@@ gging - if you're not a K@@ ra@@ v Mag@@ a grand@@ master - is to hand over your cas@@ h.
family of y@@ ob@@ s destro@@ yed Sal@@ t@@ ash@@ , Cor@@ n@@ wall coun@@ cil house ahead of ev@@ ic@@ tion
a family of y@@ ob@@ s left their coun@@ cil house with £@@ 50@@ ,000 worth of damage after they were ev@@ ic@@ ted for terror@@ ising their neigh@@ bour@@ s.
T@@ any@@ a Sk@@ el@@ d@@ on and her partner Sha@@ un Tre@@ bil@@ cock have been k@@ ic@@ ked out of the property in Sal@@ t@@ ash@@ , Cor@@ n@@ w@@ all, after a long list of complain@@ ts against them.
after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from the property, shoc@@ ked housing associ@@ ations offic@@ ers found the property in a state of dis@@ rep@@ air.
the walls were left with g@@ ap@@ ing hol@@ es, flo@@ or@@ bo@@ ards were ri@@ pped up, rub@@ b@@ ish was stre@@ w@@ n over the floor and gr@@ aff@@ it@@ i was da@@ ub@@ ed on the wall@@ s.
the family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private ac@@ com@@ od@@ ation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y, housing manager at Cor@@ n@@ wall Hous@@ ing, said she fe@@ ared it might be beyond sav@@ ing.
she said: '@@ it's been an ab@@ solute night@@ m@@ are for people down here and I don't think people should have to live like that.
there are a lot of things to we@@ igh up because this property will probably be known by the no@@ t-@@ so@@ -@@ nice element of Cor@@ n@@ w@@ all.
this family are no@@ tor@@ ious and their name is no@@ tor@@ i@@ ous.
the couple had three sons who lived at the property inter@@ mit@@ ten@@ tly and police say the re@@ ign of ter@@ ror the family in@@ flic@@ ted included fi@@ ghting in the street with bas@@ e@@ ball bat@@ s, in@@ tim@@ id@@ ating nearby resid@@ ents, drug use, drug deal@@ ing and exc@@ es@@ sive sh@@ out@@ ing, argu@@ ing and swe@@ ar@@ ing.
Sk@@ el@@ don@@ , 4@@ 7, whose name was on the ten@@ anc@@ y, was given an anti@@ social behavi@@ our order in Jun@@ e.
old rub@@ b@@ ish was found in a number of the rooms of the house, which may be dem@@ ol@@ ished
floor bo@@ ards had been pulled up in the property, from which dru@@ gs had been deal@@ t in the past
neigh@@ bour@@ s say they were seen fi@@ ghting in the street and police were regul@@ arly called
Cor@@ n@@ wall Hous@@ ing ev@@ ic@@ ted her and her partner forc@@ e@@ fully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on volun@@ tar@@ il@@ y.
the ev@@ ic@@ tion was ha@@ iled by reli@@ ev@@ ed neigh@@ bour@@ s who said their lives had been made a living h@@ ell@@ .
one said: '@@ they didn't care about any@@ bod@@ y.@@ '
we lived next to them for 20 years and it's always been b@@ ad.
the amount of times we@@ 've seen the police down here is un@@ believ@@ able.
'@@ this morning, we couldn't sleep@@ .'
we got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that@@ !
it's going to be lovely now that they're finally g@@ one.
Ad@@ am Fit@@ z@@ pat@@ ric@@ k, Cor@@ n@@ wall Hous@@ ing@@ 's neigh@@ bour@@ hood enforc@@ ement manag@@ er, said the family fail@@ ed to co@@ operate with the local author@@ ity.
the family have lived in the house for 20 years, with police regul@@ arly called to the property
rub@@ b@@ ish and old to@@ ys have been throw@@ n down the over@@ grow@@ n side of the coun@@ cil house
he add@@ ed: '@@ it is a sh@@ ame that the ten@@ ant fail@@ ed to accept any responsibility for the behavi@@ our of her and her family as ev@@ ic@@ tion is always the last course of action that Cor@@ n@@ wall Hous@@ ing consider@@ s.
this was a very difficult case as the behavi@@ our was extreme and their actions must have been terri@@ fying for her neigh@@ bour@@ s to wit@@ ness.
I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my te@@ am, Dev@@ on and Cor@@ n@@ wall Pol@@ ice and members of the community who br@@ av@@ ely came forward to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neigh@@ bour@@ s and s@@ ends out a message that anti@@ social behavi@@ our will not be toler@@ ated.
Mr Fit@@ z@@ pat@@ r@@ ick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20@@ s.
a dir@@ ty mat@@ t@@ ress left on the floor of one of the bed@@ rooms in the house after the ev@@ ic@@ tion
housing workers will now have to clear away the pil@@ es of rub@@ b@@ ish which surr@@ ound the house
in 2014, police ra@@ id@@ ed the property and found more than 70@@ g in c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is as well as scal@@ es, par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ ali@@ a and £@@ 1,@@ 700 in cas@@ h.
Sk@@ el@@ d@@ on was fin@@ ed after ple@@ ad@@ ing gu@@ il@@ ty to pos@@ session of a Class B drug with in@@ tent to suppl@@ y.
she claim@@ ed the money was going towards a head@@ stone for her son, Lee Sk@@ el@@ don@@ , who died in a car cr@@ ash in 201@@ 3.
after being made hom@@ el@@ ess, it is understood that T@@ any@@ a and her partner are now living in private housing in Pl@@ ym@@ ou@@ th.
the walls of many of the house@@ 's rooms had gr@@ aff@@ it@@ i sc@@ ra@@ w@@ led across them.
police say they will seek to ev@@ ic@@ t ten@@ ants who fl@@ out the rules of their ten@@ anci@@ es
Angel@@ a C@@ row@@ , of Dev@@ on and Cor@@ n@@ wall Pol@@ ice, said the ev@@ ic@@ tion sent a clear war@@ ning to other ten@@ ants who continue to fl@@ out the rul@@ es.
'@@ this s@@ ends out to those who feel that they can be@@ have without rec@@ ri@@ min@@ ation, as well as those b@@ ligh@@ ted by such behavi@@ our, '@@ she said.
criminal and anti@@ social behavi@@ our will never be toler@@ ated by Dev@@ on and Cor@@ n@@ wall Pol@@ ice, who will continue to work with partners to protect our comm@@ uni@@ ties.

French court rejec@@ ts bi@@ d to dem@@ ol@@ ish shops at J@@ ung@@ le refu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ p
a French court has rejec@@ ted a bi@@ d by Cal@@ ais authorities to dem@@ ol@@ ish do@@ z@@ ens of mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft shops and restaurants in the J@@ ung@@ le cam@@ p where thousands of refu@@ ge@@ es are liv@@ ing.
at a court hearing this wee@@ k, Cal@@ ais authorities had argu@@ ed the state should be able to kno@@ ck down a total of 72 mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft shops where people inside the cam@@ p sell goo@@ ds, from c@@ ig@@ are@@ t@@ tes to energy drink@@ s, offer hair@@ cut@@ s, or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents (@@ 40@@ P) or basic me@@ als for a few e@@ uro@@ s in mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft restaur@@ ants.
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ect@@ 's office argu@@ ed the places should be dem@@ ol@@ ished because they represented a par@@ alle@@ l economy that did not pay tax@@ , and because they carried fire and s@@ an@@ itation ris@@ k@@ s.
human@@ itarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vit@@ al, saying the free me@@ als offered by a state-@@ back@@ ed associ@@ ation and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp@@ .
they argu@@ ed the mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft shops and restaurants often provided shel@@ ter and free me@@ als to those in need.
a L@@ ille court rul@@ ed there was no legal basis for exp@@ elling the people running the 72 mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft sho@@ ps, but said the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ect@@ 's concer@@ ns "@@ were totally understand@@ able@@ ."
the judg@@ e, Je@@ an-@@ Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is Mol@@ l@@ a, said the gro@@ c@@ eri@@ es, caf@@ es and restaurants played a much big@@ ger role than simply feed@@ ing people that "@@ live in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous condition@@ s."
he said the sp@@ aces provided cal@@ m meeting points between refu@@ ge@@ es and volunte@@ ers.
one of the places that had been under thre@@ at from dem@@ oli@@ tion was the camp@@ 's J@@ ung@@ le Book K@@ ids "@@ Caf@@ e which is run no@@ t-@@ for@@ -@@ profit and provides 200 me@@ als a day, English and French class@@ es, and as@@ yl@@ um advice for the hundreds of vulner@@ able un@@ ac@@ compani@@ ed min@@ ors in the camp@@ .
more than 17@@ 0@@ ,000 people have signed a peti@@ tion to protect the kids "@@ caf@@ e.
a letter sent to the Gu@@ ardi@@ an said its clo@@ sure "@@ would be a cat@@ ast@@ ro@@ p@@ he for these children, some of whom are as young as ei@@ ght@@ ."
two ch@@ ari@@ ties, Help Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es and L'@@ A@@ ub@@ erge des M@@ ig@@ r@@ ants, on Fri@@ day estimated that numbers in the J@@ ung@@ le cam@@ p have ris@@ en to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest ever - after a ste@@ ep increase in arriv@@ als during the sum@@ mer@@ .
"@@ this 5@@ ,@@ 000@@ -@@ yuan sub@@ sid@@ y sol@@ ved the problem of my pres@@ sing need for mon@@ ey@@ ."
Zh@@ ou F@@ en, a girl who was registered in the po@@ ver@@ t@@ y-@@ str@@ ick@@ en file of M@@ IPO Vill@@ age, Chang@@ le Town@@ , Hu@@ ay@@ u@@ an Coun@@ ty, received the letter of ad@@ mission from University of South China.
when she was wor@@ ri@@ ed about the tui@@ tion, the coun@@ ty commit@@ tee of the Communist Youth Le@@ ague offered she a 5@@ 000@@ -@@ yuan sub@@ sid@@ y on August 9.
rec@@ ently, the related coun@@ ty government department has provided a sub@@ sid@@ y to@@ tal@@ ed 2.@@ 8@@ 38 million yuan to over 6@@ 90 po@@ ver@@ t@@ y-@@ str@@ ick@@ en college stud@@ ents.
it also organized social fun@@ d-@@ raising for students who are extremely poor in financial status to help them accompl@@ ish their stud@@ y.
this year, Hu@@ ay@@ u@@ an County integrated more than R@@ MB 18@@ .@@ 5 million of educational funds and self-@@ raised more than R@@ MB 2.@@ 5 milli@@ on, which will be injec@@ ted into the real@@ -@@ name bank accoun@@ ts of the corresponding stud@@ ents.
"I thought my el@@ der brother and I cannot af@@ ford the college study after my father passed away. it never occur@@ red to me before the coun@@ ty government helped us so tim@@ el@@ y@@ ." she said gr@@ ate@@ ful@@ ly.
as of August 8, Hu@@ ay@@ u@@ an County had raised more than 21 million yuan of various reli@@ ef funds this first half year for 13@@ ,@@ 14@@ 0 po@@ ver@@ t@@ y-@@ str@@ ick@@ en stud@@ ents.
all po@@ ver@@ t@@ y-@@ str@@ ick@@ en students of the coun@@ ty that should be supported have been supported fin@@ anci@@ ally.

according to the Xin@@ hu@@ a news ag@@ ency, Australi@@ a's New South Wal@@ es government announced on the 11@@ th day of the month that it will spend 200 million Australian dollar@@ s (@@ about 15@@ 4 million US dollar@@ s) to launch the biggest renov@@ ation on the famous Sydney Opera House since its establish@@ ment.
the New South Wal@@ es government said the renov@@ ation would not change the sh@@ ell shape of the oper@@ a house.
the Sydney Opera House is one of Syd@@ ne@@ y's land@@ mark build@@ ings, designed by Dan@@ ish architec@@ t J@@ or@@ n U@@ t@@ z@@ on and built in 197@@ 3. it wel@@ comes about 8 million visitors each year.
R@@ ory J@@ eff@@ es, general manager of the Sydney Sy@@ m@@ ph@@ ony Or@@ ches@@ tr@@ a, believes that the Sydney Opera House will make a "@@ tur@@ nar@@ ound@@ " via this renov@@ ation and become one of the world's concer@@ ts with the best sound effec@@ ts.
non-@@ permanent resid@@ ents who have lived in Beijing for more than six months and have a stable and legal employment or accommodation or conditions for continuous school@@ ing in Beijing can apply for a resid@@ ence per@@ m@@ it.
rec@@ ently, the launch of implementation details of "@@ Residence Per@@ mit Pro@@ vision@@ al Regul@@ ation@@ s" indic@@ ates that the "@@ temporary resid@@ ence per@@ mit@@ " will be upgrad@@ ed to "@@ resid@@ ence per@@ mit@@ ."
a responsible person of the relevant department said that the transition from the "@@ temporary resid@@ ence per@@ mit@@ " to "@@ resid@@ ence per@@ mit@@ " means that Beijing will shi@@ ft its administration for non-@@ permanent resid@@ ents from the "@@ manag@@ ement@@ " to multi-@@ direc@@ tional services.
to@@ day, a re@@ por@@ ter learned from the State Administration of Tax@@ ation (S@@ AT@@ ) that as of the end of June this year, the tax authorities at all levels have announced a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 70 illegal "@@ black@@ list@@ " cas@@ es.
it is understood that in July 2014, SA@@ T took the first step in the central government depart@@ ments to issue an Information Dis@@ clo@@ sure Metho@@ ds For Maj@@ or Tax Vi@@ ol@@ ations along with the Tax Credit Management Ap@@ pro@@ ach.
in addition to the illegal fac@@ ts, legal bas@@ is, the handling and punish@@ ment of these cases, the basic information of the illegal parties and the relevant inter@@ medi@@ aries will be included in the "@@ black@@ list@@ " ex@@ po@@ su@@ re.
quality inspec@@ tion, treas@@ ur@@ y, custom@@ s and other government depart@@ ments also take relevant discipl@@ inary measures against the "@@ black@@ list@@ " parties.
"the credit repair mechanism is an important mil@@ est@@ one in the construction of the tax credit system and even the credit system of the whole soci@@ ety, which indic@@ ates that the construction of our social credit system is becoming more and more mat@@ ure@@ ."
"@@ environmental problems are em@@ bodi@@ ed by the atmosp@@ here, water and soil pollu@@ tion, but the root still lies in the mode of production and liv@@ ing@@ ."
for example, the land development rati@@ o of Jiang@@ su Province was up to 21@@ % in 2015, ran@@ king top among all provinc@@ es and aut@@ onomous regions of China.
therefore, the problem of high pollu@@ tion, heavy energy consumption and land occup@@ ation has not been fundam@@ ent@@ ally addres@@ sed in the transformation of production and life sty@@ les.
on the one hand, Jiang@@ su top@@ s in the whole country from the perspec@@ tive of the establishment achiev@@ ement of ec@@ ological environment of all levels and class@@ es. but on the other hand, the resource and environment pressure is heav@@ y.
to solid@@ ly promote the ec@@ ological environment protection and govern@@ ance, we need to fundam@@ ent@@ ally promote the transformation of production and lif@@ esty@@ le and promote the transformation of people's li@@ vel@@ i@@ hood from the perspec@@ tive of ec@@ ological civil@@ ization construc@@ tion.

on January 1, 2016, the current pol@@ l@@ ut@@ ant dis@@ charg@@ ing unit which obtained environmental impact assess@@ ment shall be ex@@ emp@@ t from exp@@ end@@ it@@ ure of compens@@ ated use.
the ob@@ taining of compens@@ ated em@@ ission right is not equal to the ob@@ taining of illegal dis@@ charg@@ e, so companies cannot dis@@ charge pol@@ l@@ ut@@ ants at will@@ .
H@@ an Hong@@ y@@ an, dep@@ uty director of Qingdao Environmental Protection B@@ ure@@ au@@ , introduc@@ es that companies of illegal and exc@@ es@@ sive se@@ w@@ age must be pun@@ ished in accordance with the relevant laws and regul@@ ations. illegal enterprises cannot be allowed to circum@@ vent punish@@ ment via purchas@@ ing em@@ ission righ@@ ts.
in other words, we need to cr@@ ack down on environmental viol@@ ations through legal means and sever@@ ely pun@@ ish the enterpris@@ es' over standard dis@@ charge behavi@@ ors, so as to protect the environment and public heal@@ th.
now for their own interests, enterprises have raised their enthusi@@ as@@ m of pollu@@ tion control, ch@@ er@@ ished limited em@@ issions and reduced em@@ issions of pol@@ l@@ ut@@ ants.
with the economic interests driv@@ e, to reduce pol@@ l@@ ut@@ ant@@ s' dis@@ charge has shif@@ ted from the govern@@ ment@@ 's mand@@ atory behavior into a consci@@ ous market behavi@@ or, so as to truly protect the environment, nature and public heal@@ th.
em@@ ission right, also known as "@@ d@@ um@@ ping right@@ ," means the right to dis@@ charge pol@@ l@@ ut@@ ants. it refers to the right for em@@ it@@ ters to dis@@ charge pol@@ l@@ ut@@ ants to the environment in line with the law within the quo@@ ta as@@ signed by the govern@@ ment.
this right is ess@@ enti@@ ally the right of the em@@ it@@ ters to occup@@ y, use and benefit from environmental capacity resources.
nex@@ t, under the pre@@ mise that the total dis@@ charge of pol@@ l@@ ut@@ ants does not exc@@ eed the total allow@@ able em@@ ission volum@@ e, the internal resources of pollu@@ tion began to sw@@ ap dis@@ charge cap@@ aci@@ ties via currency ex@@ change.
since the pro@@ position of em@@ issions trading by American econom@@ ist D@@ yers in 196@@ 8, it has been applied by the United States of America to the management of atmosp@@ her@@ ic and river pollu@@ tion sources since the 19@@ 70@@ s.
since its pil@@ ot in China in 200@@ 7, it has been applied to 14 provinc@@ es (@@ aut@@ onomous regions and municip@@ ali@@ ti@@ es) including Zhe@@ jiang and Jiang@@ su@@ .
according to the Ministry of Def@@ ense of Russi@@ a, in order to assist the air attack of the six strategic b@@ om@@ bers on the "@@ Islam@@ ic State@@ " target in Syri@@ a, a number of Russian fi@@ gh@@ ters lif@@ ted from the Syri@@ an Mah@@ m@@ ir Air Force base to provide sup@@ port.
on February 22 this year, the United States and Russia reached a c@@ eas@@ e@@ fire agreement on the Syri@@ an conflic@@ t. the c@@ eas@@ e@@ fire agreement will be imple@@ mented since February 27@@ .
under the agre@@ ement, the c@@ eas@@ e@@ fire does not include a military stri@@ ke against terror@@ ist organizations including "@@ Islam@@ ic State@@ " and "@@ Sal@@ v@@ ation Fron@@ t@@ ," which were identified by the United N@@ ation Security Counc@@ il.
Russia will continue to build the relevant military infrastructure in the base and the living conditions of the Russian sol@@ di@@ ers will be protected correspon@@ d@@ ing@@ ly.
he also said that if the extrem@@ ist forces were not h@@ it, these forces will be extended to Russi@@ a.
although Russia and the West did not reach an agreement on the cooperation against the extrem@@ ist forces of Syri@@ a, Russia would strengthen cooperation with Syri@@ a, Ir@@ an and I@@ ra@@ q in this regard@@ .
in September 2015, Russi@@ a, at the inv@@ itation of the Syri@@ an govern@@ ment, began a military stri@@ ke against Syri@@ an extrem@@ ist forc@@ es.
on March 15 this year, Russi@@ a's major military forces began to ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ate, but the Russian side promised to continue to retain the military base in He@@ im@@ i M@@ im@@ i and the nav@@ al base in T@@ art@@ us.

to@@ day, 100@@ ,000 people on average visit Zh@@ ush@@ an each year, bringing a variety of ideas or seeking inner pe@@ ace.
in fact, the relationship between the village and the city should compan@@ ion@@ ship with, just like mother and chil@@ d. no matter strong or weak@@ . there is no need for any party to be governed by the other party. such a relationship is warm@@ .
there is no fixed pattern of r@@ ural development, but it is quite difficult to just rely on spon@@ tane@@ ous r@@ ural chang@@ es. one of the most important changes is to let the right people go to vill@@ ages.
Shanghai S@@ ong@@ jiang District Tra@@ ff@@ ic Control Department recently used electronic police to monitor whether the driver plays mobile phone while driv@@ ing. as a result, more than 30 cases were detec@@ ted in a wee@@ k.
with the popul@@ arity of smart phon@@ es, mobile phones become more and more fun@@ n@@ y. We@@ Ch@@ at, micro@@ b@@ logg@@ ing and even gam@@ es, shopping on Ta@@ ob@@ ao have become norm@@ al. it seems that many people cannot leave the phone for a moment, and cannot stop even when driv@@ ing.
according to "@@ Road Tra@@ ff@@ ic Safety Ac@@ t@@ ," mobile phones playing are ban@@ ned and defined as "@@ behavior pre@@ vent@@ ing safe driv@@ ing@@ ."
un@@ fortun@@ ately, due to some reasons such as the large number of illegal cases and difficul@@ ty in ob@@ taining evid@@ ences, those people have never been pun@@ ished and make the laws become a kind of decor@@ ation.
if the traffic control department can be determined to decl@@ are war to the mobile phone playing behavior while driving and nor@@ mal@@ ize such measure@@ s, such illegal behavi@@ ors will su@@ rely be cur@@ bed.
the public security organ shall be strict with household registration management by grad@@ ually establish@@ ing electronic and paper files for people without Hu@@ k@@ ou (@@ household registr@@ ation) and ensure the comple@@ ten@@ ess and valid@@ ity.
the public security organ shall promp@@ tly notify the relevant depart@@ ments of the registration of people without Hu@@ k@@ ou@@ .
the policy measures that are in@@ consistent with the idea of this implementation will receive a centr@@ alized clean@@ up. they should be correc@@ ted and ab@@ ol@@ ished if necess@@ ary.
in the collec@@ tive gre@@ en@@ house of Dong@@ lin village of Ta@@ ic@@ ang City, the 48@@ -@@ year-@@ old W@@ ang X@@ u@@ ef@@ en is leading workers to pe@@ ar spr@@ ay p@@ es@@ tic@@ ides on pe@@ ar tre@@ es.
there are 150 ac@@ res of or@@ ch@@ ards and more than 10 speci@@ es, but only 12 workers plus a technical engine@@ er are o@@ k.
last year, the income was a total of R@@ MB 50@@ ,@@ 000@@ . I cannot ear@@ n so many if i work in the factory because of such age.
last year, the income of Dong@@ lin village reached R@@ MB 22 milli@@ on, of which total agricul@@ tural income accoun@@ ted for nearly a hal@@ f@@ .
according to S@@ u Q@@ if@@ ang, the village secre@@ tar@@ y, per cap@@ ita land cultiv@@ ation area increases each year. 50 m@@ u (@@ a unit of area, one "@@ mu@@ " = 0.@@ 0@@ 66@@ 7 h@@ ec@@ ta@@ res@@ ) in the beginning and over 100 m@@ u now. the re@@ venue per m@@ u increases every year and the income of professional farm@@ ers also have room for growth every year.
with shares quanti@@ fying to each vill@@ ag@@ er, the high@@ light of the r@@ ural collec@@ tive economic reform is to be clear about the property rights of r@@ ural collec@@ tive management and expl@@ oring political and economic separ@@ ation.
in July 2015, on An@@ zh@@ en Street of W@@ ux@@ i X@@ ish@@ an District, 14 r@@ ural economic cooperation organizations worked with the village commit@@ tee to implement "@@ sub-@@ account manag@@ ement@@ ." the village commit@@ tee imple@@ mented r@@ ural public aff@@ airs management while the cooper@@ ative organizations were mainly engaged in business.
with two accoun@@ ts for two institu@@ tions, this can prevent the village c@@ ad@@ res from particip@@ ating in collec@@ tive asset management corrup@@ tion.
Zh@@ u Ba@@ op@@ ing, dep@@ uty director of the Jiang@@ su Prov@@ in@@ cial Agricul@@ ture Commit@@ te@@ e, said that the next step of Jiang@@ su government is to continue to promote the reform of community cooperation system, encourage farm@@ ers to jointly develop and establish a vill@@ ag@@ e-@@ level democr@@ atic power operation mechan@@ ism.
according to Zh@@ u Ba@@ op@@ ing, they should further move forward the re@@ form, engage in community shares cooper@@ ation, quanti@@ fy the assets to mem@@ b@@ ers, fix it to farm@@ ers and produce clear property righ@@ ts.
through the Internet +@@ , we shall provide farm@@ ers with the rights to know, participate in decision@@ -@@ making and democr@@ atic management and turn such rights into stand@@ ardi@@ zed mechanism of cooper@@ ation.
at pres@@ ent, the new collec@@ tive economy in southern Jiang@@ su village mainly consists of four development mod@@ es, including asset le@@ as@@ ing, enterprise stoc@@ k, agricul@@ tural development and joint development.
it is understood that overseas exhibi@@ tions have become important platform for the "@@ Belt and Road Initi@@ ati@@ ve@@ " development.
the success of these overseas exhibi@@ tions has acc@@ um@@ ulated valuable experience and laid a good foundation for the continuous expl@@ oration of emerging markets along the "@@ Belt and Road Initi@@ ati@@ ve@@ " road and building overseas exhibition integrated platform@@ .
pe@@ ak will always be oriented to promoting consumer demand, building sports industry eco@@ sp@@ here and acceler@@ ating the strategic upgrad@@ ing of single s@@ porting goods manufacturing enterprise to professional sports service enterpris@@ es.
Ham@@ ir also said that another 34 people were inj@@ ure@@ d. among them, three fire@@ fi@@ gh@@ ters suffer@@ ed from min@@ or injur@@ ies and were dis@@ charg@@ ed.
as some of the ten@@ ants were still mis@@ s@@ ing, he also called on resid@@ ents of the fire@@ places to contact the authori@@ ties.
it is reported that, M@@ s. D@@ u Le@@ i (@@ Mari@@ ana Tur@@ ay@@ ) who has been living in this apartment for 30 years, said: "@@ it seems like a b@@ om@@ b fall@@ ing down@@ ."
it is reported that the local fire bri@@ g@@ ade spent an hour and 45 minutes to put out the fire and resid@@ ents of the nearby buildings were allowed to return in a few hour@@ s.
American Red Cross staff estimated that about 100 people were hom@@ el@@ ess, 60 to 70 among which were mostly his@@ pan@@ ic and stayed in the shel@@ ters nearb@@ y.

Xi@@ am@@ en girl Zh@@ ang B@@ in@@ b@@ in: "@@ hand@@ some hand@@ s" encourage her to start sho@@ o@@ ting care@@ er, which saw several "@@ re@@ ver@@ se@@ "
Zh@@ ang Don@@ gh@@ ong, a vill@@ ag@@ er of the East Park Vill@@ age, Xi@@ am@@ en Xi@@ ang@@ '@@ an District, changed his 29@@ -@@ inch old TV into a 6@@ 5-@@ inch TV just a few days before.
the ordinary farm@@ er has a daugh@@ ter, named Zh@@ ang B@@ in@@ b@@ in. she is the one to win San@@ zi final silver med@@ al of Olympic Games Women@@ 's 50@@ -@@ meters ri@@ f@@ le games for China in the evening of the elev@@ en@@ th.
in the evening of the 11@@ th day of the month, just in front of this new TV set, the Zh@@ ang Don@@ gh@@ ong couple and their do@@ z@@ ens of rel@@ atives and friends have wit@@ ness@@ ed the mag@@ ic process for the cou@@ ple@@ 's daughter to catch up and reverse from almost being elimin@@ ated in the pre@@ li@@ min@@ aries to almost win@@ ning.
at the gam@@ e, Zh@@ ang B@@ in@@ b@@ in was ran@@ ked in the middle and lower re@@ aches and it seemed she was still quite far away from the fin@@ al.
but her parents and friends did not give up, kept watching the live and saw other players fin@@ ish the game. Zh@@ ang B@@ in@@ b@@ in raised her ran@@ ks all the way and finally came to the fin@@ al. at this time, a bur@@ st of che@@ ers broke out in her home.
in the fin@@ al, Zh@@ ang B@@ in@@ b@@ in also started from l@@ agg@@ ing behind and shot more st@@ ably and won the silver med@@ al with just 0.2 r@@ ings behind the champ@@ ion.
this year, the 27@@ -@@ year-@@ old Zh@@ ang B@@ in@@ b@@ in, in the 16@@ -@@ year sho@@ o@@ ting care@@ er, has actually mis@@ sed the silver med@@ al for several times.
according to her mother Zh@@ ang Xi@@ a@@ ol@@ ong, her daughter sent a few "@@ little per@@ su@@ ad@@ ers@@ " from her village at their hes@@ it@@ ation.
these little per@@ su@@ ad@@ ers are girls and bo@@ ys of her village who were recommended to atten@@ d the training at the same time, including Zh@@ ang B@@ in@@ b@@ in@@ 's c@@ ous@@ in.
just after coming to Xi@@ am@@ en te@@ am, Zh@@ ang B@@ in@@ b@@ in once again took the initi@@ ative to return to Xi@@ ang@@ '@@ an school because of her family difficul@@ ties.
but after the repe@@ ated efforts of her en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ing teach@@ er, Zh@@ ang B@@ in@@ b@@ in returned to Xi@@ am@@ en team@@ .
and after she came into the prov@@ in@@ cial te@@ am, Zh@@ ang B@@ in@@ b@@ in returned home because she found it almost ho@@ p@@ eless to enter the national team after a long time.
this time, not only the co@@ ach Zh@@ ang Y@@ a@@ ji@@ e, but also the leaders and co@@ ach of Xi@@ am@@ en sho@@ o@@ ting arch@@ ery sports center and Fu@@ j@@ ian prov@@ in@@ cial team came to her home. with their effor@@ ts, Zh@@ ang B@@ in@@ b@@ in was finally per@@ su@@ ad@@ ed to return to the prov@@ in@@ cial team@@ .
just at y@@ ester@@ day@@ 's gam@@ e, the Xi@@ am@@ en girl achieved several re@@ vers@@ als of the sho@@ o@@ ting with her ins@@ isten@@ ce.
"@@ each co@@ ach has his own method to choose the potential play@@ er. I decided to take her once I saw her beautiful hand@@ s."
Zh@@ ang Don@@ gh@@ ong also rec@@ alle@@ d, in the training te@@ st, although the results of her daughter were not the b@@ est, her r@@ ings were very st@@ able, which is also an important reason for Zh@@ ang B@@ in@@ b@@ in to at@@ tract co@@ ach@@ es.
during the training process of Zh@@ ang B@@ in@@ b@@ in, it was the input of this farm@@ er girl that impres@@ sed Zh@@ ang Y@@ a@@ ji@@ e mo@@ st.
he rec@@ all@@ ed that after Zh@@ ang B@@ in@@ b@@ in came into the Xi@@ am@@ en sho@@ o@@ ting team more than a year later, the team carried out a long shot of gun train@@ ing, requ@@ iring players not to move for half an hour@@ .
Zh@@ ang Xi@@ a@@ ol@@ ong told re@@ por@@ ters that her daughter has always been a quiet and well-@@ be@@ ha@@ ved child, with the ho@@ b@@ by of painting and produc@@ ing to@@ y@@ s.
"I used to make clothes and do some s@@ ow@@ ing job@@ s. B@@ in@@ b@@ in pic@@ ked up some sc@@ r@@ aps to make her own dol@@ l@@ s."
she said, her daughter often se@@ w@@ ed hand to@@ y@@ s. pl@@ us, she is good at painting and could make ani@@ mated to@@ ys from the dol@@ l@@ 's fac@@ ial features to clo@@ thing.
as an ath@@ le@@ te, Zh@@ ang B@@ in@@ b@@ in and her family are separate more than being together. as she can only return home during f@@ esti@@ vi@@ ties, she mainly contac@@ ts family members by phone in other time.
according to her paren@@ ts, no matter meeting in person or talking by phone, Zh@@ ang B@@ in@@ b@@ in sel@@ dom tal@@ ked about her hard work but more about some happy things.
because they cannot often see their daugh@@ ter, they put away the pain@@ tings of her child@@ hood and hon@@ ors of con@@ secu@@ tive years.
Zh@@ ang Xi@@ a@@ ol@@ ong showed the anim@@ ation show of her daughter to the re@@ por@@ ter, "@@ She should keep drawing instead if she did not become sho@@ o@@ ter@@ ."
in the living room on the second floor of Zh@@ ang B@@ in@@ b@@ in, there was a cup@@ board filled with med@@ als and certific@@ ates.
Zh@@ ang Don@@ gh@@ ong put away the med@@ als ne@@ at@@ ly and placed all certific@@ ates into files for stor@@ age. "@@ this is hon@@ or made by B@@ in@@ b@@ in after a do@@ z@@ en of year@@ s' effor@@ ts. we feel quite ch@@ er@@ ish@@ ed@@ ."
rec@@ ently, He@@ bei Ci@@ xi@@ ao Fund sent a 16@@ ,@@ 000@@ -@@ yuan reli@@ ef sent to six families who lost their rel@@ atives in Xi@@ ao@@ z@@ u@@ o, Ta@@ it@@ ou and Gu@@ i@@ qu@@ an Village of J@@ inj@@ ing Coun@@ ty.
this is another con@@ dol@@ ence and care activity after the fun@@ d associ@@ ation rele@@ ases the call for finding "@@ ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed children and l@@ on@@ ely old men ca@@ us@@ u@@ ed by the f@@ lood dis@@ aster in July 19, 201@@ 6@@ ."
the 7@@ 19 heavy ra@@ inf@@ all caused heavy dis@@ aster to many cities of He@@ bei Province and resul@@ ted in the f@@ lood dis@@ aster of some regions in He@@ bei provinc@@ e. during the perio@@ d, some people were dead and mis@@ s@@ ing.
the good man "@@ La@@ o Ti@@ e" sacri@@ fic@@ ed his life when he helped the community on dra@@ in@@ age, leaving a 2-@@ year-@@ old ki@@ d and a wife with chil@@ d. the moving story of the good man "@@ La@@ o Ti@@ e" made the entire prov@@ in@@ cial capital mo@@ ved.
on August 4, the working personnel of He@@ bei Prov@@ in@@ cial Ci@@ xi@@ ao Fund and volunte@@ ers of He@@ bei Brand Association came to his home and offered his rel@@ atives with 3,@@ 200@@ -@@ yuan love don@@ ation.
when Y@@ e Li@@ , the v@@ ice president of He@@ bei Brand Association ack@@ now@@ ledg@@ ed the situation of "@@ La@@ o Ti@@ e@@ ," they immediately decided to carry out "@@ love char@@ ity@@ " activities among enterprise members to help "@@ old ir@@ on@@ " family to ride out the stor@@ m.
He@@ bei Prov@@ in@@ cial Ci@@ xi@@ ao Fun@@ d, known as Ci@@ xi@@ ao Fund of the He@@ bei Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Service Found@@ ation, was initi@@ ated by the He@@ bei Brand Pre@@ par@@ atory Commit@@ te@@ e, and established in August 201@@ 5.
according to a Hong Kong Ori@@ ental D@@ aily report made on August 12, the current diamond sales in Main@@ land China were acc@@ used of three major proble@@ ms, including the false mar@@ king of diamond cl@@ arity to raise sales pric@@ e, false diamond weight and un@@ guaranteed after@@ sal@@ es, etc.
An@@ tw@@ er@@ p is one of the world's largest diamond trading center@@ s. the diamond cutting technology of local ar@@ tis@@ ans is well-@@ know@@ n. all diam@@ on@@ ds on sale have under@@ gone ri@@ gor@@ ous identi@@ fic@@ ation, deep@@ ly wel@@ com@@ ed by the main@@ land la@@ di@@ es.
"@@ a small clo@@ th b@@ ag@@ , holding in one's hand, such ligh@@ t-@@ weigh@@ ted, is worth of almost one million yu@@ an@@ ," a woman sur@@ named Li@@ u who particip@@ ated in the purchase of diam@@ on@@ ds told of her experience in An@@ tw@@ er@@ p last June to the main@@ land medi@@ a.
she bur@@ ied the diamond in her ling@@ erie and carried it all day al@@ ong, including when she went to toil@@ et and took bath@@ .
she said the diamond she bought in An@@ tw@@ er@@ p was pric@@ ed about R@@ MB 55@@ ,000 per gr@@ am and diamond of the same quality was re@@ tail@@ -@@ pric@@ ed about R@@ MB 11@@ 1@@ ,000 in Xi@@ a@@ '@@ men.
rec@@ ently, she sold the diamond with 120@@ % more than the price she bought and ear@@ ned two hundred thousand yu@@ an.
according to the provisions of the Main@@ land Custom@@ s, diam@@ on@@ ds are neither supplies nor nec@@ essi@@ ties during the trip and thus bel@@ ong to the scope of goo@@ ds. so such diamond should be declared at entry and ex@@ it. otherwise, it shall be classi@@ fied as sm@@ u@@ gg@@ l@@ ing. people may be sen@@ ten@@ c@@ ed to j@@ ail@@ .
according to foreign media report@@ s, on the 10@@ th day of the month of the local time, the British Prime Min@@ ist@@ er's Down@@ ing Street announced that British Prime Minister Ter@@ es@@ a Me@@ i will go to Switzerland to spend the summer vac@@ ation, but did not disclose the specific place.
according to some medi@@ a, after the British refer@@ end@@ um off Europe, the new British Prime Minister cho@@ se to spend her vacation on the "@@ neu@@ tral countr@@ y@@ ," Swiss on the European contin@@ ent. this is sy@@ mb@@ ol@@ ic.
the British "@@ Gu@@ ardi@@ an@@ " commen@@ ted that the sy@@ mb@@ olic neu@@ tr@@ ality nature of the Swiss played a role in the choice of the British Prime Min@@ ist@@ er's first resor@@ t.
British "@@ D@@ aily T@@ ele@@ graph@@ " commen@@ ted that Ter@@ es@@ a Me@@ i cho@@ se to take a vacation in Switzer@@ land. this is the first time that the British Prime Minister cho@@ se to go vacation in Swiss after Mar@@ g@@ are@@ t Th@@ at@@ ch@@ er.
the choice of these two female pri@@ me minist@@ ers is quite a contr@@ ast to the hot place which Bl@@ air and Cam@@ er@@ on, the two male pri@@ me minist@@ ers like to go to.
it is reported that the new British Prime Minister Ter@@ es@@ a Me@@ i will return to London on August 24@@ . a series of important work and activities will be waiting for her.
the British par@@ li@@ ament will res@@ ume on September 5. the subject matter covers the second Bre@@ x@@ it refer@@ end@@ um required by the inter@@ net@@ .
on June 23, the British held a refer@@ end@@ um for Bre@@ x@@ it, but the British new pri@@ me min@@ ister did not want to start the article 50@@ , which is involved with the Lisbon Treat@@ y before the end of the year.
there are 1,@@ 3@@ 25 existing int@@ ang@@ ible cultural her@@ itage projects in Hu@@ ang@@ sh@@ an. its number and quanti@@ ty ran@@ ked first in An@@ hu@@ i provinc@@ e.

China's Mar@@ s program is coming
China Mar@@ s expl@@ oration mission aim@@ s to achieve surround@@ ing, land@@ ing and pat@@ roll@@ ing at one time, which has never occur@@ red in foreign countries.
China's Mar@@ s expl@@ oration launch target is to step ar@@ ound, land and pat@@ ro@@ l at one time. such task has consider@@ able diffic@@ ult@@ y.
because the Mar@@ s pro@@ be can encoun@@ ter a time window in 26 months, experts are closely working on the project plan and try to launch the first Mar@@ s pro@@ be in 20@@ 20@@ .
according to X@@ u D@@ az@@ h@@ e, although China's air@@ craft has entered a deep space, it is still essential to fin@@ ish the task of Mar@@ s expl@@ or@@ ation. the detection of Mar@@ s means that China has ste@@ pped into the deep space expl@@ oration era in a true sen@@ se.
"@@ every two or three years, there is a chance that Mar@@ s is clos@@ est to Ear@@ th. and at this point, it is most energy efficient to launch the vehic@@ le@@ ."
"@@ taking into account the mass of Mar@@ s detec@@ tors, it will be the job of China's Long March 5 carrier roc@@ ket to complete the launch mission@@ ."
China's Mar@@ s expl@@ oration mission aim@@ s to achieve surround@@ ing, land@@ ing and pat@@ roll@@ ing at one time, which has never occur@@ red in foreign countries. there was one time of surrounding and land@@ ing before in foreign countries, but the land@@ ing fail@@ ed.
Mar@@ s expl@@ oration invol@@ ves a lot of technical areas. in particul@@ ar, although the ro@@ ver is a space detec@@ tor, it has a distinc@@ tive feature compared with the general space detec@@ tor.
in other words, the Mar@@ s pro@@ be should be capable of determin@@ ing the driving route and equipped with the ability to find ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les.
according to P@@ ang Z@@ hi@@ ha@@ o, a research@@ er of the fif@@ th in@@ stitute of China's A@@ ero@@ space Science and Technology Group, the reason for human being to fav@@ or Mar@@ s expl@@ oration is because Mar@@ s detection has significant scientific and technical mean@@ ings and it even matters to the future of human be@@ ings.
curren@@ t@@ ly, the Mar@@ s has become the plan@@ et with the highest degree of human resear@@ ch. the history of human be@@ ings to use space detec@@ tors for Mar@@ s expl@@ oration almost goes across the entire history of human space expl@@ or@@ ation.
therefore, the human be@@ ings hope that one day on the Mar@@ s to establish a base of resid@@ ence, and ul@@ ti@@ mately to Mar@@ s im@@ migr@@ ation, it turned into a second home of man@@ kind@@ .
a large number of signs also show that the Mar@@ s is likely to be the same as the current Ear@@ th, only after billi@@ ons of years of ev@@ olution into the atmosphere th@@ in, low temperat@@ ure, water dep@@ le@@ tion and so on.
therefore, the detection or man@@ ned land@@ ing on the Mar@@ s for research can help pro@@ pose a pre-@@ arrang@@ ed planning to prevent the earth from becoming the second Mar@@ s which is difficult for human be@@ ings to in@@ hab@@ it.
as of June 2016, the world conducted a total of 11@@ 4 lun@@ ar expl@@ or@@ ations, including 43 Mar@@ s detection mission@@ s.
however, ever since the 199@@ 0@@ s, a total of 18 human expl@@ or@@ ations have been carried out and only 14 lun@@ ar detec@@ tions have been conduc@@ ted.
there are currently five Mar@@ s or@@ bit@@ ers and two Mar@@ s ro@@ vers at work, but only one lun@@ ar or@@ bi@@ ter and one lun@@ ar land@@ er are at work.
world space pow@@ ers have developed a detection plan with the Mar@@ s system as tar@@ get@@ . so we can see the current Mar@@ s detection is hot@@ ter than that of mo@@ on detec@@ tion.
on Nov@@ . 5, 201@@ 3, India launched the first Mar@@ s pro@@ be "@@ M@@ ang@@ ali@@ an@@ ," and has become Asi@@ a's first country for successful detection of the Mar@@ s.
"@@ M@@ ang@@ ali@@ an@@ " is used to study the sur@@ face, the atmosphere and min@@ eral characteristics of the Mar@@ s and explore whether there are signs of me@@ th@@ ane and life on the Mar@@ s.
the hard@@ est part of the mission is that the pro@@ be just has one chance before entering the Mar@@ tian atmosphere for a@@ er@@ od@@ ynam@@ ic shape and par@@ ach@@ ute dec@@ eler@@ ation.
according to Sun Z@@ e@@ zhou, the chief design@@ er of a Mar@@ s detec@@ tor of the China A@@ ero@@ space Science and Technology Corpor@@ ation, the Mar@@ s expl@@ oration task is con@@ fron@@ ted with many technical challeng@@ es.
the atmosp@@ her@@ ic pressure of the Mar@@ s is very low, only 1@@ % of the Ear@@ th@@ 's surface atmosp@@ her@@ ic pressu@@ re, with high un@@ certain@@ ty.
scienti@@ sts have not had a thor@@ ough understanding of Mar@@ s factors such as its changes and stor@@ m character@@ is@@ tics.
a d@@ ust stor@@ m similar to the Ear@@ th@@ 's d@@ ust is often formed in the Mar@@ s in the sum@@ m@@ er, which will lead to a shar@@ p decline in solar energ@@ y. so a "@@ sleep@@ " mode must be designed for the Mar@@ s ro@@ ver and let it wait pati@@ ently until the dis@@ appearance of d@@ ust stor@@ ms.
at the same time, the Mar@@ tian atmosphere has a reducing effect on sun@@ light, which pos@@ es a problem for the energy supply for Mar@@ s detec@@ tion.
this requires that the detec@@ tor@@ 's sun wing area to be larg@@ er, and need to constantly adjust@@ , and st@@ rive to al@@ ign with the sun direc@@ tion.
in addition, since the grav@@ ity of the Mar@@ s is only 38@@ % of that of the earth and much higher than that of the Mo@@ on sur@@ face, so the pro@@ be requires higher pow@@ er.
"the core and the most difficult part of the Mar@@ s expl@@ oration mission are the a@@ er@@ od@@ ynam@@ ic shape and par@@ ach@@ ute dec@@ eler@@ ation process after the pro@@ be enter@@ s Mar@@ tian atmosp@@ here. there is just one chance to ensure success@@ ."
according to Sun Z@@ e, it must rely on the detec@@ tor to complete the entire process because the distance between the Earth and the Mar@@ s is quite larg@@ e.
because there is not so much pro@@ p@@ ell@@ ant to off@@ set the high spe@@ ed, the slow@@ down should rely on the atmosphere of the Mar@@ s while land@@ ing the Mar@@ s. however, it is quite difficult to simul@@ ate the atmosphere of the Mar@@ s on earth.
P@@ ang Z@@ hi@@ ha@@ o said, in gener@@ al, the way to detec@@ t the Mar@@ s is similar to the way to detec@@ t the mo@@ on. the entire process is also "@@ surround@@ ing, land@@ ing, pat@@ roll@@ ing and retur@@ n@@ ing@@ " to achieve the goal of man@@ ned land@@ ing on the Mar@@ s.
because the distance between the Mar@@ s and the earth is larger than that between the Mo@@ on and Ear@@ th, it needs to over@@ come a series of more complex technical difficul@@ ties before the Mar@@ s detec@@ tion.
according to Taiwan@@ ese media report@@ s, L@@ in Qu@@ an, the head of Taiwan@@ 's Executive Yu@@ an, announced y@@ ester@@ day morning, "@@ Ill@@ -@@ gotten Party Ass@@ ets Hand@@ ling Regul@@ ations by political parties and their ac@@ company@@ ing organiz@@ ation@@ s" will take effective since today.
K@@ M@@ T V@@ ice Chair@@ man Zh@@ an Q@@ i@@ xi@@ an said, "@@ Ku@@ om@@ int@@ ang, with a hundred years of history, will step down otherwise without social commitment and responsi@@ bil@@ ity@@ ."
L@@ in Qu@@ an stres@@ sed that if the political part@@ y, ac@@ company@@ ing organization or tr@@ us@@ te@@ es are in viol@@ ations of the regulations which pro@@ hi@@ bit provisions b@@ an, the Commission will investi@@ gate and pun@@ ish "@@ according to the law@@ ."
L@@ in Qu@@ an also announced that Hong Pe@@ ig@@ en, "@@ Dep@@ uty Director of the In@@ depend@@ ent@@ ," will serve as the v@@ ice ch@@ air@@ man of the Ill@@ -@@ gotten Party Ass@@ ets Set@@ t@@ le@@ ment Commit@@ te@@ e.
he said that G@@ u Li@@ xi@@ ong will be the most appropriate can@@ di@@ date for the Ill@@ -@@ gotten Party Ass@@ ets Hand@@ ling Regul@@ ations. the experience of Hong Pe@@ ig@@ en who deal@@ t with the major cases will serve as the foundation for the commit@@ tee to un@@ cover the related Ill@@ -@@ gotten Party Ass@@ ets.
Zh@@ an Q@@ i@@ xi@@ an said that, as long as there are party assets to@@ day, no one will give you social don@@ ations. so if the party were all conf@@ is@@ c@@ ated away, then Ku@@ om@@ int@@ ang can just ask for social support and spon@@ sor@@ ship, "You will have chance to go when there are no ass@@ et@@ s."
Zh@@ an Q@@ i@@ xi@@ an also stres@@ sed that even if the Ill@@ -@@ gotten Party Ass@@ ets Hand@@ ling Regul@@ ations goes into effect and the Ku@@ om@@ int@@ ang party assets are not fully conf@@ is@@ c@@ ated, the rest will continue to be conf@@ is@@ c@@ ated as promis@@ ed, the party asset will go n@@ ull and the party will start from sc@@ rat@@ ch.
original tit@@ le: suit launched by "@@ cor@@ rid@@ or doc@@ tor@@ " L@@ an Yu@@ ef@@ eng against CC@@ TV host W@@ ang Z@@ hi@@ '@@ an for reputation infring@@ ement fails in instance judg@@ ment
the legal evening new@@ s: because the CC@@ TV host W@@ ang Z@@ hi@@ '@@ an published his re@@ marks against the "@@ cor@@ rid@@ or doc@@ tor@@ " event on micro@@ b@@ logg@@ ing, L@@ an Yu@@ ef@@ eng brought W@@ ang Z@@ hi@@ '@@ an and Beijing Mic@@ ro Dre@@ am Ch@@ u@@ ang@@ ke Network Technology Co., Ltd. to the cour@@ t.
y@@ ester@@ day afterno@@ on, Hai@@ di@@ an court sen@@ ten@@ c@@ ed the case and the ver@@ dic@@ t said that W@@ ang Z@@ hi@@ '@@ an and Mic@@ ro Dre@@ am Company did not constitute the infring@@ ement and dis@@ mis@@ sed the L@@ an Yu@@ ef@@ eng for all the claim@@ s.
at the beginning of 2014, CC@@ TV re@@ por@@ ter W@@ ang Z@@ hi@@ '@@ an found after his surve@@ y that although L@@ an Yu@@ ef@@ eng was sitting in the cor@@ rid@@ or for more than 600 days and was shap@@ ed as the tr@@ ag@@ ic her@@ o sup@@ pressed by the medi@@ a, these reports had a lot of false information.
on March 29@@ , 2014, the "@@ cor@@ rid@@ or doc@@ tor@@ " program produced by CC@@ TV news surve@@ y broad@@ cas@@ ted.
all information about the so@@ -@@ called over@@ -@@ medical treatment reported by L@@ an Yu@@ ef@@ eng to the media do not have any evidence sup@@ port.
in the micro@@ b@@ logg@@ ing with real@@ -@@ name certific@@ ation, W@@ ang Z@@ hi@@ '@@ an also said that the reason for L@@ an Yu@@ ef@@ eng to become this is because of his st@@ ub@@ born characters and par@@ ano@@ id personal@@ ity. "
LA@@ N Yu@@ ef@@ eng claim@@ ed that W@@ ang Z@@ hi@@ '@@ an should delete the micro@@ b@@ logg@@ ing and apo@@ logi@@ zed to him and made compens@@ ation of 100@@ ,000 yuan for the mental damage sol@@ ati@@ um.
at the time of the tri@@ al, the two sides argu@@ ed whether W@@ ang Z@@ hi@@ an viol@@ ated the reputation right of L@@ an Yu@@ ef@@ eng@@ .
high@@ light of the 12@@ th day of the month@@ : at the beginning of Tr@@ ack and Fi@@ eld Ev@@ ents, the Chinese team is quite busy and the wom@@ en@@ 's football associ@@ ation aim@@ s to become the top four of the b@@ ic@@ ycle games
the b@@ ic@@ ycle game is expected to realize the "@@ zer@@ o break@@ through@@ " in the Olympic gold med@@ al while the Women@@ 's World Cup girls will challenge Germany te@@ am, the world champ@@ ion win@@ ner for twice and are expected to become the top four@@ .
W@@ ang Zh@@ en was quite outstanding in the two rac@@ es. he won silver med@@ al for the ath@@ le@@ tics world champ@@ ion@@ ship held in Beijing last year and was upgrad@@ ed to the individual project champ@@ ion in the world champ@@ ion@@ ship this M@@ ay.
according to foreign media report@@ s, Zh@@ ang Hu@@ iz@@ h@@ en, the 27@@ -@@ year-@@ old Korean arch@@ ery female player won the gold med@@ al in the wom@@ en@@ 's arch@@ ery individual tour@@ nam@@ ent. this is the second sc@@ oring of Olympic gold med@@ al following the team competi@@ tion. this made she become a double win@@ ner.
Zh@@ ang Hu@@ iz@@ h@@ en is considered as a late b@@ loom@@ er. she re@@ gre@@ ts about not winning the last session of the London Olympic Games tickets before@@ , but now she pr@@ ou@@ d@@ ly stands on the top of the Rio Olympic po@@ di@@ um.
Zh@@ ang Hu@@ iz@@ h@@ en won the gold med@@ al in Lis@@ a W@@ eng@@ lu@@ , a total score of 6-@@ 2 in the wom@@ en@@ 's arch@@ ery fin@@ als at the Sam@@ ba Boulev@@ ard in Rio de Jan@@ ei@@ ro@@ , Braz@@ il.
she did arch@@ ery for the first time in the fourth grade of primary scho@@ ol. she won the first individual tour@@ nam@@ ent gold med@@ al when she was 27 in 201@@ 4. so she is a late b@@ loom@@ er.
Zh@@ ang Hu@@ iz@@ h@@ en rec@@ alle@@ d, "@@ My performance before high school was too bad to enable me to participate in the national competi@@ tion.
Zh@@ ang Hu@@ iz@@ h@@ en was ran@@ ked the fourth at the London Olympic Games quali@@ fication tri@@ als. un@@ fortun@@ ately, she lost the Olympic ad@@ mission and can just watch her col@@ le@@ ague and good friend Q@@ i Pu@@ bei score two gold med@@ als.
Zh@@ ang Hu@@ iz@@ h@@ en tal@@ ked about his gold winning after the wom@@ en@@ 's individual aw@@ ards cerem@@ ony of arch@@ er@@ y. "I tried to sho@@ ot one by one until the la@@ st. may@@ be it is because this brings me good results and makes me conten@@ ted@@ ."
the 28@@ -@@ year-@@ old Korean arch@@ ery "@@ No.@@ 1@@ ," and the London Olympic Games arch@@ ery individual tour@@ nam@@ ent win@@ ner Q@@ i Fu@@ bei won the br@@ on@@ ze med@@ al.
Q@@ i Fu@@ bei was de@@ fe@@ ated by Zh@@ ang Hu@@ iz@@ h@@ en in the sem@@ i@@ fin@@ als and compe@@ ted for the br@@ on@@ ze med@@ al with the Mex@@ ican player Alexand@@ ra Val@@ enci@@ a.

fir@@ st@@ ly, the co@@ aching staff acc@@ um@@ ulated rich experience in his grad@@ ual stud@@ y. second@@ ly, it needs scientific train@@ ing, which should be acc@@ um@@ ulated over time.
the Ar@@ ch@@ ery team helped the team players focus and remain un@@ bi@@ ased via military training and going through the c@@ em@@ et@@ ery during night.
although not yet confirm@@ ed, it is said by many sources that App@@ le's 2016 aut@@ um@@ n conference will be held in Septem@@ ber, and i@@ Ph@@ one@@ 7 would really be launched into the market.
although Apple did not respon@@ d, there are news release about the function and configuration of the new i@@ Ph@@ one. there are even the images of i@@ Ph@@ one@@ 7 "@@ real machine mod@@ el@@ " on the inter@@ net@@ .
the new generation of iPhone is really "@@ ey@@ e-@@ cat@@ ch@@ ing@@ ," hot and hard@@ -to-@@ get@@ . if you want to buy the gen@@ u@@ ine product at the first time, you must choose a good chann@@ el, for example, Sun@@ ing.
this has exac@@ er@@ b@@ ated people's dis@@ appoint@@ ment of the new i@@ Ph@@ one, "It is leng@@ then@@ ed, but cannot be used to cast ho@@ lo@@ graphic imag@@ es! this generation of iPhone is so terri@@ ble@@ ."
i@@ Ph@@ one@@ 7, just like other i@@ Ph@@ on@@ es, brings coun@@ t@@ less secret before bir@@ th.
in addition, there are a number of sources claim@@ ing that the new generation of iPhone will have the 3.@@ 5@@ mm head@@ phone j@@ ack canc@@ el@@ led, and adop@@ t Bluetoo@@ th connection and charg@@ ing interface in@@ ste@@ ad, which will provide space for Apple to add a second speak@@ er.
another evidence to support this news is that as early as 2014, Apple will allow head@@ set manufacturers to produce head@@ set products via produc@@ ing charg@@ ing inter@@ face.
another evidence to confirm this message is that Apple allows the head@@ phone manufacturer to produce head@@ phone via the connection of charge inter@@ face.
whether these news are true or false will not be un@@ ve@@ iled until the 2016 Apple aut@@ um@@ n confer@@ ence.
but this does not prevent the industry in@@ sid@@ ers to be optim@@ istic about the pro@@ spec@@ ts of i@@ Ph@@ one@@ 7 - many people think that i@@ Ph@@ one@@ 7 will be likely to become the last major upgrade of App@@ le's iPhone seri@@ es, although it can be seen from the data released by the market research institu@@ tion ID@@ C that the market share of iPhone will decline to some degre@@ e.
among them, Gol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s ran@@ ked App@@ le's stock to be the rating of "@@ bu@@ y@@ ing@@ " while B@@ M@@ O analy@@ st thought that i@@ Ph@@ one@@ 7 will obtain a historical high sales achiev@@ ement.
mean@@ while, Broad@@ co@@ m CE@@ O Ho@@ ck T@@ an also said that App@@ le's future re@@ venue growth will likely be more than 20@@ %, which is entirely due to the introduction of i@@ Ph@@ one@@ 7.
7@@ % of respon@@ d@@ ents said they have the plan to buy i@@ Ph@@ one@@ 7, while only 4@@ % people had the plan to buy i@@ Ph@@ one@@ 6.
it is understood that currently 20@@ % of user groups of i@@ Ph@@ one@@ 6 or 6@@ Plus have such a plan to purchase i@@ Ph@@ one@@ 7. this is a quite high pro@@ por@@ tion.
second@@ ly, according to expert analys@@ is, most of the iPhone f@@ ans like to replace their own iPhone mobile ph@@ one.
according to statis@@ tics, among all iPhone us@@ ers, about 26@@ % of users have not changed their phones for 2 years. that is, almost 120 million users of i@@ Ph@@ ones have been using the same iPhone for 2 years.
according to medi@@ a, Taiwan wit@@ ness@@ ed several earth@@ qu@@ ak@@ es during the production period of i@@ Ph@@ one@@ 7. "the destruc@@ tion of T@@ SM@@ C production facilities is beyond imag@@ ination and may impact the initial supply of i@@ Ph@@ one@@ 7@@ ."
supply and demand con@@ trad@@ ic@@ tion will affect the average us@@ er, so it is time to choose a good channel and purchase the gen@@ u@@ ine i@@ Ph@@ one@@ 7 for the first time.
according to inform@@ ed sourc@@ es, rec@@ ently, Sun@@ ing execu@@ tives and Apple frequently me@@ et, with the purpose to prepare ad@@ equ@@ ate suppl@@ y.
operators have negoti@@ ated with Sun@@ ing. so it is fo@@ res@@ ee@@ able that, with the depth of cooperation between the two sid@@ es, lower prices and more in@@ timate services will in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably bring to users.
"@@ with the lowest pric@@ e, the consumer may@@ " buy i@@ Ph@@ one@@ 7 with just 7 yuan per day. "
ad@@ equ@@ ate supply and a variety of conc@@ ession@@ s will alle@@ vi@@ ate the pressure of i@@ Ph@@ one@@ 7 bu@@ y@@ ing. Sun@@ ing@@ 's logistics will change such good feeling into more in@@ tui@@ tive sense of experience.
may@@ be you'll get a call at mid@@ night. "@@ hel@@ lo@@ , Sun@@ ing T@@ es@@ co, your i@@ Ph@@ one@@ 7 is here@@ ."
the organiz@@ ers hope that the local people can understand more about the history of Chinese culture via the cultural rel@@ ics exhibi@@ tion, there@@ by enh@@ ancing the mutual understanding and friend@@ ship between the two peop@@ les.
as part of the European tour@@ , Barcelon@@ a's "@@ M@@ ing D@@ yn@@ ast@@ y Heritage Ex@@ hibi@@ tion@@ " will continue until early Octo@@ ber.
y@@ ester@@ day, Hu@@ ax@@ ia Bank and Shanghai P@@ ud@@ ong Development Bank issued a semi-@@ annual report of the year 201@@ 6. in the second quar@@ ter, China Secur@@ ities Fin@@ ance Corporation Limited (@@ CS@@ F@@ C) will once again buy their sha@@ res.
among them, CS@@ F@@ C will hold an additional 29@@ .@@ 29@@ 31 million shares of Hu@@ ax@@ ia Ban@@ k. by the end of Jun@@ e, CS@@ F@@ C will increase its shares of Hu@@ ax@@ ia Bank to 38@@ 7 million sha@@ res, raising its shares of Hu@@ ax@@ ia Bank from 3.@@ 35@@ % to 3.@@ 6@@ 2@@ %.
according to the esti@@ ma@@ tes of China Mer@@ ch@@ ants Secur@@ ities, d@@ educ@@ ted from the sha@@ res, CS@@ F@@ C will hold another 38 million shares of P@@ ud@@ ong Development Bank in the second quarter and raise its shares to almost 600 million sha@@ res, which account for 2.@@ 77@@ % of the bank sha@@ res.
rec@@ ently, Shi@@ zi B@@ ang He@@ bo Park, Zh@@ eng@@ f@@ u vill@@ age, T@@ ong@@ xi@@ ang City, Zhe@@ jiang prov@@ ince will be open to vill@@ ag@@ ers and tou@@ rists form@@ ally.

according to foreign media report@@ s, the "@@ green po@@ ol@@ " incid@@ ent of Rio Olympic Games g@@ ained much attention because its di@@ ving pool water was changed from blue to gre@@ en.
however, on the morning of the 10@@ th day of the month, the water of the match pool adj@@ ac@@ ent to the water pool also turned gre@@ en.
Australian water pol@@ o con@@ test@@ ant said that his eyes feel ting@@ ling and would like to sh@@ ed te@@ ar@@ s.
previ@@ ously, Rio offici@@ als confirm@@ ed the situation of water gre@@ en@@ ing, and said the water color is due to the weak@@ ening of al@@ k@@ al@@ ine reasons and will not affect the ath@@ le@@ te@@ 's heal@@ th.
however, after Australian players achieved success with the Japanese dele@@ gation in the water pol@@ o pool, they said their eyes felt pr@@ ick@@ ing.
when the water of di@@ ving pool turned gre@@ en, the hosting party worked over@@ time to deal with the di@@ ving pool problems in the evening of the 9@@ th day of the month and found the rapid change of water pol@@ o pool in the morning of the 10@@ th day of the mon@@ th.
during the competition period of the Australia and Japanese te@@ am, the environmental conditions of the water pol@@ o p@@ ond grad@@ ually wor@@ sen@@ ed, but the official stres@@ sed that they would manage to return the water quality of the two po@@ ols to their original col@@ ors on the 11@@ th day of the mon@@ th.
Mari@@ o An@@ dr@@ ad@@ a, the spo@@ k@@ es@@ man of Rio Olympic Games said, "The al@@ k@@ al@@ in@@ ity of water quality in the di@@ ving pool fir@@ st@@ ly turned we@@ ak after the y@@ ester@@ day afterno@@ on@@ ."
"@@ we learned about a series of causes that could cause dis@@ col@@ oration of water and result in the al@@ k@@ al@@ in@@ ity of water qual@@ ity@@ ."
the water sports center conducted a series of tests on water quality, and hundreds of di@@ vers and sw@@ imm@@ ers used the swimming pool to determine whether the water quality me@@ ets crit@@ eri@@ a. "
"@@ we have been following the normal procedure these days, but we may have over@@ looked the impact of more ath@@ le@@ tes on water qual@@ ity@@ ."
"@@ but the change in water color certainly has no effect on heal@@ th, especially for ath@@ le@@ te@@ s."
"@@ this independent team confir@@ ms our assess@@ ment and confir@@ ms the measures we have taken to restore the normal color and normal chemical status of the po@@ ol@@ ."
"@@ we had ho@@ ped that the pool would return to normal color in the morning, but the speed of recovery was affected by the ra@@ in@@ ."
according to Taiwan@@ 's "The Central News Ag@@ ency@@ ," one j@@ ail in the sub@@ ur@@ b of the Man@@ il@@ a area saw a b@@ om@@ bing ev@@ ent, resulting in the death of 10 pris@@ on@@ ers, including two Chin@@ ese, and the injury of the ward@@ en.
according to the AB@@ S-@@ CB@@ N tele@@ vision, the event occur@@ red at Par@@ ana@@ que pris@@ on around 9 o@@ '@@ c@@ lock last night, but the police did not make a pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary statement until 2 am today.

Ur@@ um@@ qi nor@@ mal@@ izes the operating order of travel tour@@ ism market and regul@@ ates that travel ag@@ encies must sign contrac@@ ts with tou@@ rists
curren@@ t@@ ly, Xin@@ jiang has entered pe@@ ak tourist seas@@ on. in order to regul@@ ate the management order of tour@@ ism F@@ IT market, y@@ ester@@ day Ur@@ um@@ qi City Tourism Law En@@ forc@@ ement Det@@ ach@@ ment worked with the law enforc@@ ement det@@ ach@@ ment of Ur@@ um@@ qi Trans@@ portation Authority to investi@@ gate and deal with the non-@@ norm@@ ative travel vehicles ex@@ istent in the tour@@ ism F@@ IT market, and the low contract sig@@ ning between the travel agency and tou@@ rist@@ s.

"@@ hel@@ lo@@ , I am from the Ur@@ um@@ qi City Tourism B@@ ure@@ au@@ . did you sign with the travel ag@@ ency@@ ?"
Y@@ u B@@ in, the working staff of law enforc@@ ement det@@ ach@@ ment of Ur@@ um@@ qi Trans@@ portation Authority expl@@ ain@@ ed, "The foreign tourist bus and bus line worked on tourist transport project in Ur@@ um@@ qi market, but they did not have quali@@ fic@@ ation@@ ."
"@@ a fine of 30@@ ,000 to 100@@ ,000 yuan will be im@@ posed for operation beyond scop@@ e. the driver who did not have a quali@@ fication certificate will pay R@@ MB 2@@ ,000 for fin@@ e."
it is reported that the Ur@@ um@@ qi City Tourism Law En@@ forc@@ ement Department has investig@@ ated the places including West Park and Hong@@ shan where the independent travelers are centr@@ aliz@@ ed.
after integr@@ ating the inspection tw@@ ice, M@@ a Q@@ i, the dep@@ uty head of Ur@@ um@@ qi City Tourism Law En@@ forc@@ ement Det@@ ach@@ ment said that, "@@ Safety first, nor@@ m secon@@ d. no small matters for the travel vehic@@ les. and people will be inj@@ ured and killed in groups in case of any ques@@ tion@@ s."

on the morning of August 12, the State Council Information Office held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in July 201@@ 6.
Shen@@ g Y@@ un@@ y@@ un@@ , spo@@ k@@ es@@ man of National B@@ ure@@ au of Statis@@ tics and head of National Economic Statis@@ tics Di@@ vision said that, in J@@ ul@@ y, the part index number of national economy slow@@ ed relatively but still operated in the reasonable rang@@ e.
according to the data of National B@@ ure@@ au of Statis@@ tics, the fixed asset investment grow@@ th, total im@@ ports and other data in July have come down.
Shen@@ g L@@ ai@@ y@@ un said, as for the national economy in J@@ ul@@ y, I would like to use the words of Premi@@ er, "the shape is vol@@ ati@@ le and the potential is still good@@ ." this is a better way to sum@@ mar@@ ize the characteristics of the economic operation in J@@ ul@@ y.
he expl@@ ained that "the shape of the fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ation@@ s" refers to the fall after rise of some economic indic@@ ators growth rate in J@@ ul@@ y.
in J@@ ul@@ y, the domestic and international economy is still in the deep adjust@@ ment, the international situation is complex and vol@@ ati@@ le and the world economic recovery is less than exp@@ ec@@ ted, so the export pressure is still relatively heav@@ y.
as for the domestic situ@@ ation, the whole economy is still in the critical stage of adjust@@ ment, adjustment labor pain@@ s are rele@@ as@@ ing and the economy is under great pressu@@ re, so some indic@@ ators are still fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ating.
Shen@@ g L@@ ai@@ y@@ un poin@@ ted out that there was a special case in J@@ ul@@ y, with serious f@@ loo@@ ds, high temperature and hot weather which have brought some impact on production and operation of some areas.
according to the recent report of the Ministry of Civil Aff@@ air@@ s, more than 60 million people were aff@@ ec@@ ted, with direct economic losses of more than 200 billion yu@@ an.
from the view of industri@@ al, investment and trans@@ port@@ -@@ related indic@@ ators, these areas are affected to var@@ ying degre@@ es.
the car@@ go tur@@ no@@ ver growth rate in July fell back 3.@@ 6 percentage and f@@ loo@@ ds on these areas have a certain impact on traff@@ ic.
from these fac@@ tors, it is quite normal to have some fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ations in some indic@@ ator@@ s. and such thing is exp@@ ec@@ ted.
he said, "The potential is still good@@ " means that despite the fall@@ back of economic grow@@ th, the overall economic performance is stable and ste@@ ad@@ y. and the good moment@@ um has not chang@@ ed.
in J@@ ul@@ y, CP@@ I rose by 1.@@ 8@@ %, with a month@@ -@@ on-@@ month rise of 0.@@ 2@@ %. from January to J@@ ul@@ y, CP@@ I rose by 2.@@ 1@@ %, so the overall price situation is st@@ able.
according to the statistics of hot weather in the di@@ stric@@ ts and coun@@ ties by the port@@ al of the Ch@@ ong@@ q@@ ing Munic@@ ip@@ al B@@ ure@@ au of Mete@@ or@@ olog@@ y, in addition to You@@ y@@ ang, the rest of the city can receive different degre@@ es of high temperature allow@@ ance.
at pres@@ ent, at least 28 provinc@@ es in the country have clearly defined the standard of the allow@@ ance, but the standards issued by provinc@@ es and municip@@ alities are not the sam@@ e, and people in Ch@@ ong@@ q@@ ing receive the allow@@ ance based on the count of high-@@ temperature working days.
in case of temperature between 35 and 37 ℃@@ , people can receive allow@@ ance of no less than 10 yuan per day. in case of temperature above 37 ℃@@ , people are released with the allow@@ ance of not less than 15 yu@@ an.
in case of temperature above 40 ℃@@ , staff working in high temperature can receive up to 20 yuan per day of allow@@ ance (@@ but for labor@@ ers who enjoy the high temperature job allow@@ ance@@ ).
in accordance with this stand@@ ard, people in K@@ ai@@ zhou which has the highest number of high temperature can receive 3@@ 30 yu@@ an. and people in Cheng@@ k@@ ou with the least days of high temperature can receive 80 yu@@ an. and the maximum temperature of You@@ yang did not meet the high temperature standard@@ s, so there is no high temperature allow@@ ance.
in the p@@ ast, many companies adop@@ t c@@ ool drin@@ ks as high temperature allow@@ ance. the city safety super@@ vision bu@@ re@@ au deemed that this behavior does not meet the current regul@@ ation.
employ@@ er shall not d@@ educ@@ t or reduce the w@@ ages of workers in case of termin@@ ating work and reducing working hours in high temperature we@@ ather@@ .
the city's Human Resources and Social Security B@@ ure@@ au said that if employees did not receive high temperature allow@@ ance while working under high temperat@@ ure, they may fight for the legitimate rights and interests via the labor dispute medi@@ ation organization or di@@ al 12@@ 33@@ 3 for complain@@ t.
if the emplo@@ ying unit ref@@ uses to pay the high temperature allow@@ ance, the lab@@ ore@@ r may lo@@ dge a complain@@ t with the competent department of human resources social security at the coun@@ ty level or abo@@ ve.
at the same time, because the high temperature allow@@ ance is part of the w@@ age and not wel@@ f@@ are, such allow@@ ance shall be included in the total w@@ ages, with tax d@@ educ@@ ted.
so the high temperature allow@@ ance is not within the minimum w@@ age, it must be issued in cash and not sub@@ stitu@@ ted by physical objects such as drink@@ s.
the newly built Ur@@ um@@ qi station is located in Ur@@ um@@ qi high-speed r@@ ail area, with the whole construction area of around 100@@ ,000 square met@@ ers.
the layer 1 and 2 are for entr@@ ance, waiting room and offic@@ e, commercial use while the layer -@@ 1 is for ex@@ it.
at pres@@ ent, Ur@@ um@@ qi station is Xin@@ ji@@ ang@@ 's largest integrated transport h@@ ub@@ , integrated with high-speed rail@@ , r@@ ail trans@@ port@@ ation, public transportation and rental as one. people can achieve a variety of seam@@ less do@@ ck@@ ings.
there are a total of 3 ticket off@@ ices on the north and south sides of the platform lay@@ er, equipped with manual ticket@@ ing windows and 34 automatic ticket machin@@ es.
there are a total of 30 channels on the east and west side of the waiting h@@ all. passeng@@ ers can check the ticket on the ticket number for quick inspection and wa@@ it@@ ing.
if you need hel@@ p, you can choose the 41 call buttons and get timely services.
from July 1 on@@ ward@@ s, the old passenger station, that is, the passenger train of Ur@@ um@@ qi South Station is shif@@ ted to Ur@@ um@@ qi station.
in other words, all the CR@@ H train@@ s and the 30 p@@ airs of other train@@ s de@@ par@@ ting from Xin@@ jiang can be par@@ ked at Ur@@ um@@ qi Station.
now, passeng@@ ers can buy tickets at these two st@@ ations. the train pass@@ ing time between these two stations is about 10 minutes. passeng@@ ers need to pay attention to the detailed name of the initial and terminal station on the ticket@@ .
Ur@@ um@@ qi new passenger station, after its official laun@@ ching into oper@@ ation, will become an important platform to build the national integrated transport city and promote the construction of "@@ Sil@@ k Road Economic Z@@ on@@ e" and the new di@@ stric@@ t.

at the press conference on August 10, after post@@ oper@@ ative re@@ h@@ abil@@ it@@ ation, G@@ res@@ ham finally appeared and showed people its brand new 3D printing plastic be@@ ak@@ .
this tou@@ c@@ an, which had its be@@ ak bro@@ ken and was d@@ ying just one year and a half ago, finally reg@@ ained its new life.
this day not only announced that it has rest@@ ored health by 100@@ %, but also sign@@ aled its moving into the luxury avi@@ ary to meet its human friend@@ s.
the new@@ com@@ er Gre@@ ci@@ a was slightly sh@@ y initi@@ ally, but soon became li@@ vel@@ y, roll@@ ing in the bas@@ in fro@@ lic and eating grap@@ es with a new be@@ ak@@ .
in order to re@@ mind people that it has suffer@@ ed dam@@ age, the technical staff did not give it a new be@@ ak col@@ or, but to retain the original white color of the 3D print materi@@ al.
the be@@ ak is a thin layer of hor@@ ny she@@ ath@@ , which is hol@@ low inside and only has some of the thin b@@ one to sup@@ port.
despite this internal rein@@ forc@@ ement, the tou@@ can@@ 's be@@ ak is frag@@ ile and may be bro@@ ken when it is hur@@ t.
animal res@@ c@@ ue center, or@@ ni@@ tho@@ log@@ ist and a US 3D printing company worked together to prepare several "@@ test be@@ ak@@ " for Gr@@ ac@@ ia and finally built a "@@ perfect be@@ ak@@ " for it.
now Gr@@ ac@@ ia has been able to use the new be@@ ak to drink water, e@@ at, and even p@@ ec@@ k fine gr@@ ain@@ s.
"the design of the finished product costs about two months and it just takes 4-@@ 5 hours to print it."
"@@ 3D printing is not the future technology but really enter@@ s into your life@@ ." Thom@@ as L@@ ang@@ e, the ch@@ air@@ man of US SG@@ 3D printing company said in an inter@@ view with Xin@@ hu@@ a Inter@@ nation@@ al.
in January 2015, Gr@@ aci@@ a, lying on a f@@ arm in the town of A@@ la@@ ju@@ ela in the middle of Costa Ric@@ a, was found with blood covering on its body.
at that time, its be@@ ak was cru@@ el@@ ly bro@@ ken by a group of young people. it was completely unable to eat and d@@ y@@ ing.
after the tr@@ ag@@ edy of the Gr@@ ac@@ ia was reported by the medi@@ a, there are a ti@@ de of animal anti-@@ ab@@ use call occur@@ ring inside and outside Costa Ric@@ a.
people demand to establish more ri@@ gor@@ ous animal protection law to enhance the punish@@ ment against ab@@ users.
people came spon@@ tane@@ ously to try their ut@@ most to help Gr@@ ac@@ ia restore its life before hur@@ t@@ ing.
even the invent@@ or of the 3D printing technology, Ch@@ uck H@@ ul@@ l, is also involved in the design of the Gr@@ ac@@ ia be@@ ak@@ .
"the situation of Gr@@ ac@@ ia is very speci@@ al, and its remaining part of the be@@ ak is less than 1 c@@ en@@ timet@@ er, so there are many difficul@@ ties in install@@ ing the new be@@ ak@@ ."
"@@ we first sc@@ an@@ ned Gr@@ ac@@ ia and then designed and produced an extended pro@@ s@@ thes@@ is slightly longer than the rest of its be@@ ak and fixed on its be@@ ak with gl@@ u@@ e."
"@@ this can reduce the risk of further in@@ tr@@ usive damage to Gr@@ aci@@ a@@ ," L@@ ange told Xin@@ hu@@ a Inter@@ nation@@ al.
before install@@ ing the pro@@ s@@ thes@@ is, the staff cle@@ ared the bro@@ ken be@@ ak of Gr@@ ac@@ ia every day to prevent infec@@ tion.
thousands of miles away, the story of the Tou@@ can Gr@@ ac@@ ia touched the famous docu@@ mentary director Paul@@ a El Re@@ i@@ dia and the news channel produc@@ er John Ho@@ ff@@ man.
they recorded a little bit of the process of install@@ ing a new be@@ ak@@ , and recorded a docu@@ mentary "The Country of Tou@@ can@@ ," which was played this month on the Anim@@ al Plan@@ et Chann@@ el.
the docu@@ mentary "The State of the Tou@@ can@@ " shows people how a small Tou@@ can has changed a country and how people get involved in the fight against tor@@ ture of anim@@ als.
core T@@ ip@@ : Japanese oil companies expressed v@@ ig@@ il@@ ance to the rise of Chinese oil companies, especially known as the "@@ te@@ ap@@ ot@@ " of China's small independent refin@@ er@@ y.
August 12 report on Can@@ k@@ ao@@ xi@@ a@@ ox@@ i website@@ : Japan@@ 's largest oil company J@@ X Energy believes that "@@ China's export expansion is one of the reasons for the market down@@ tur@@ n@@ ."
Japanese oil companies expressed v@@ ig@@ il@@ ance to the rise of Chinese oil companies, especially known as the "@@ te@@ ap@@ ot@@ " of China's small independent refin@@ er@@ y.
China's oil products are grad@@ ually close to Japan@@ 's oil products because the Chinese government has streng@@ then@@ ed environmental protection regul@@ ations.
before ob@@ taining the import license for cr@@ ude o@@ il, "@@ te@@ ap@@ ot refin@@ er@@ y" generally refin@@ es oil from the heavy o@@ il, which has high sul@@ fu@@ r content and is im@@ ported from Russi@@ a.
the pet@@ ro@@ le@@ um products are poor in quality due to high sul@@ fu@@ r content and become one of the causes of environmental pollu@@ tion.
after ob@@ taining cr@@ ude oil import licens@@ e, "@@ te@@ ap@@ ot refin@@ er@@ y" can import O@@ man cr@@ ude oil and Russian cr@@ ude o@@ il, which have low sul@@ fu@@ r content and improved pet@@ ro@@ le@@ um products.
East Fu@@ el General Oil Company said, "@@ With China's domestic oil product quality standards continuing to impro@@ ve, the refin@@ ing capacity of the equipment also increas@@ ed.
as a result, the quality of oil products ex@@ ported from China grad@@ ually riv@@ all@@ ed that of Japan (the world's highest qual@@ ity@@ ).
according to J@@ X En@@ erg@@ y, "@@ After the end of 2015, China began to export high-quality light oil to Australi@@ a@@ ." such light oil products are competitive with Japanese products on the Asian market.
although the "@@ Japanese high quality o@@ il@@ " f@@ alls into a cris@@ is, the Japanese oil companies just adopted the strategy of "@@ ex@@ porting to prof@@ itable areas while being concerned about the market@@ ."
as China's ex@@ ports of pet@@ ro@@ le@@ um products have a huge impact on the Asian market, te@@ ap@@ ot refin@@ ery got more atten@@ tions.
2016 Li@@ qu@@ n sun@@ sh@@ ine student support action of Y@@ ang@@ t@@ ze E@@ ven@@ ing News started from May 26@@ . after two months of registr@@ ation, the total number of poor students applying for grants is up to 800@@ .

according to the statistics bu@@ re@@ au@@ , the population growth of New Zealand had previously exceed@@ ed 2@@ % in 197@@ 4 and during the 19@@ 50@@ s-@@ 19@@ 60@@ s ("@@ baby bo@@ om@@ "@@ ).
as of June this year, New Zeal@@ and@@ 's net inf@@ low of im@@ mig@@ ran@@ ts within 12 months was 69@@ ,@@ 100@@ , making it the main driver of New Zeal@@ and@@ 's population growth in recent years.
in addition, in the same perio@@ d, New Zeal@@ and@@ 's population increased by 28@@ ,@@ 200@@ .
data shows that in the last 10 years, the average annual net inf@@ low of im@@ mig@@ ran@@ ts in New Zealand is 2@@ 1,@@ 8@@ 00, with natural population growth of 32@@ ,@@ 300 people.
from the population structure point of view, a large influ@@ x of im@@ mig@@ ran@@ ts means that the rati@@ o of "@@ working age popul@@ ation@@ " aged 15 to 39 years old grad@@ ually exp@@ and@@ ed.
as of June 2016, New Zeal@@ and@@ 's work@@ ing-@@ age population rose by 3.@@ 6 percent to 1.@@ 58 milli@@ on.

at 10 o@@ '@@ c@@ lock y@@ ester@@ day morning, X@@ 900@@ 3 international car@@ go flights were leaving the Xi@@ '@@ an Xin@@ zh@@ u r@@ ailway station and bound for Kaz@@ akh@@ stan@@ 's Al@@ mat@@ y.
the successful launch of this train marked that Xi@@ '@@ an Railway B@@ ure@@ au has successfully launched 10@@ ,000 carri@@ ages since the start of Sin@@ o-@@ Asia international car@@ go f@@ ligh@@ ts.
it is understood that the goods category of this freight train cover six major categori@@ es, nam@@ ely industrial raw materials, machinery and equipment, industrial sp@@ are part@@ s, building materials, food, light industrial products, and 20@@ 6 vari@@ e@@ ties in to@@ tal@@ .

it is understood that the first carri@@ age of goods of Sin@@ o-@@ Asia freight train@@ s are "@@ Made in Sha@@ anxi@@ ." and now, it has attrac@@ ted a large number of foreign sourc@@ es.
as of the end of J@@ ul@@ y, the volume of contain@@ er received for Sin@@ o-@@ Asia freight train@@ s reached 64@@ ,000 TE@@ U@@ , an increase of 8@@ % over the same period in 201@@ 5.
with the increase of the operation of Sin@@ o-@@ Asia freight train@@ s, the freight volume of the Xin@@ zh@@ u Railway Station of Xi@@ '@@ an Railway B@@ ure@@ au increased year by year.
in 2015, the car@@ go through@@ put of the Xin@@ zh@@ u Railway Station of the whole year reached 2.@@ 47@@ 7 million ton@@ s. as of August 10, 2016, the volume of car@@ go has reached 1.@@ 5@@ 31 million ton@@ s, represent@@ ing an increase of 6.@@ 7@@ % over the same period last year.

U@@ V not only t@@ ans your skin but also sun@@ bur@@ ns it, so how to make the skin go through the military train@@ ing, without sun@@ bur@@ n@@ ?
sun@@ block is generally marked with SP@@ F and P@@ A on the pack@@ age. SP@@ F refers to Sun Protection Fun@@ c@@ tion and is targeted at U@@ V@@ B@@ . the common SP@@ F index includes 15, 30, 50@@ , etc.
the product marked with P@@ A is for U@@ V@@ A, so that sun@@ block will play a more effective ro@@ le. us@@ u@@ ally, the inten@@ s@@ ity of P@@ A is represented with +@@ . an extra + indic@@ ates extension of effective protection time.
wat@@ er-@@ based sun@@ block with a strong pen@@ et@@ r@@ ation is often applied to o@@ ily sk@@ in. sun@@ screen spr@@ ay is also a good cho@@ ice.
cre@@ am@@ y sun@@ screen is often applied to dry sk@@ in. the classi@@ fication of neu@@ tral skin generally has no strict rul@@ es. any kind of skin care products are bur@@ den to the sensitive sk@@ in. so it is recommended to choose pure physical sun@@ screen products.
remember to apply sun@@ block half an hour in adv@@ ance, because sun@@ screen products take time to completely pen@@ et@@ rate into the sk@@ in.
because you are exposed to sun longer during the military train@@ ing, you have to apply the sun@@ screen products once every two hours to leng@@ then the effect. so keep doing it.
as the skin has just been stim@@ ulated by the sun@@ 's s@@ ak@@ e, do not immediately use wh@@ i@@ ten@@ ing products after retur@@ ning from military train@@ ing.
after expos@@ ure under the b@@ la@@ zing sun for quite a long time, please w@@ ra@@ p the ice with tow@@ el to ease the sun@@ bur@@ ned skin and alle@@ vi@@ ate the local heat if condition allow@@ ed.

this trade show attrac@@ ts investment and exhibition worldwid@@ e. in particul@@ ar, it enh@@ ances the inv@@ itation on countries and target market countries related to the Belt and Road Initi@@ ati@@ ve.
this exhibition st@@ riv@@ es to accompl@@ ish 60 investment sig@@ ning projec@@ ts, introduce 22 billion yuan of fun@@ d, sign more than 16@@ 0 trade contrac@@ ts, which to@@ tal@@ ed 3.@@ 2 billion Yu@@ an.
it is reported that the reason for "@@ Hun@@ an Fair@@ " to be sett@@ led in Lou@@ di for seven con@@ secu@@ tive years is the strong foundation of manufacturing industry in Lou@@ di@@ , Hun@@ an, which bo@@ as@@ ted long history of industrial development.
as the host place of "@@ Hun@@ an Ex@@ position@@ ," Lou@@ di has established trade relationship with more than 90 countries around the world.
"@@ Hun@@ an Ex@@ position@@ " has become an important platform for the local place to cultiv@@ ate the development of character@@ istic industries and promote the "@@ go@@ ing-@@ out@@ " of character@@ istic industri@@ es.
during some nigh@@ ts, the ion@@ ized layer is full of free electron@@ s, which means that the radio signal can go fur@@ ther.
according to the report of Popular Sci@@ ence, an American month@@ ly website, on August 11, the US Air Force was interested in cop@@ ying this effect.
although the stable ion@@ izing layer with a large number of free electron@@ s may help people listen to the radio at the edge of a university radio station, but this may not be the interest of the US Air For@@ ce.
ion@@ ization layer full of electron@@ s indicated the radio used by the military has a larger range of broad@@ cast@@ s. in addition, it may prevent the global position@@ ing system (G@@ PS@@ ) signal from the solar stor@@ m.
the final goal may be to build a series of cu@@ be satellite according to the require@@ ment. they may enhance ion@@ ization layer when necess@@ ary.
but fir@@ st@@ ly, the team that signed contract with the air force must prove that the scientific principles will work.
industry data showed that the total size of co@@ al production in 2015 was close to 6 billion tons and the national co@@ al production over@@ capacity reached 1.@@ 8 billion ton@@ s.
over the past dec@@ ad@@ e, the State Council has issued a total of five notic@@ es for the elim@@ ination of exc@@ es@@ sive and back@@ ward production capac@@ ity.
although the first four notic@@ es are not directly involved with co@@ al industry, the target industry is directly related with co@@ al industry.
from last November to this Jan@@ u@@ ary, the price of Q@@ in@@ hu@@ ang@@ dao 5@@ 500 k@@ cal ste@@ am co@@ al ling@@ ers at 37@@ 0 yuan / ton and 90@@ % of the co@@ al enterprises fell into a los@@ s.
and since Febr@@ u@@ ary, co@@ al prices grad@@ ually pic@@ ked up, Q@@ in@@ hu@@ ang@@ dao ste@@ am co@@ al prices rose continuously for four wee@@ ks, rose to 16 months high@@ , once cli@@ m@@ bed to 4@@ 36 yuan per ton, up nearly 70 yuan per ton over the begin@@ ning.
with the price ris@@ ing, come along the concer@@ ns of various industri@@ es: will a number of small co@@ al min@@ es res@@ ume produc@@ tion?
in this reg@@ ard, Ku@@ ang Xi@@ an@@ m@@ ing, head of the Economic Research Institute of the China (H@@ ain@@ an@@ ) Re@@ form and Development In@@ stitu@@ te, conducted an analysis and inter@@ pret@@ ation.
Ku@@ ang Xi@@ an@@ m@@ ing: over@@ capacity cut rou@@ sed the high concer@@ ns to various industri@@ es. the report card of the over@@ capacity cut of the co@@ al industry announced today make everyone feel wor@@ ri@@ ed inde@@ ed.
these three super@@ fic@@ ial factors reflect the reason behind the relative l@@ agg@@ ing behind of our growth pattern change. that is, the govern@@ ment@@ -@@ led growth has not yet been fundam@@ ent@@ ally chang@@ ed.
secon@@ d, it is also directly related with the force of local govern@@ ment. during the over@@ capacity cut process, the funds and the corresponding supporting measures should be in place. from this point of view, the differ@@ ences are inde@@ ed relatively large among different region@@ s.
thir@@ d@@ ly, some of the provinc@@ es that are relatively s@@ low in progress may face greater risks if they seek acceler@@ ation in progress in the second half of the year.
in this case, rel@@ ying on the central allow@@ ance to raise funds to promote the process of production capacity may have a negative imp@@ ac@@ t.
first, the over@@ capacity cut is not a simple c@@ ap control.
our goal is to elimin@@ ate the back@@ ward production capac@@ ity, promote the optim@@ ization of the structure and re@@ structure the new format of the entire co@@ al industry.
during the process of over@@ capacity cut dep@@ loy@@ ing, the local government must combine the production capacity and the transformation and upgrad@@ ing of the co@@ al industry to develop the relevant service industry.
secon@@ d, in order to complete this year@@ 's over@@ capacity cut task within this year, we must give full play to the power of administrative super@@ vision@@ .
fin@@ ally, we should strengthen the role of social secur@@ ity.
because the market is directly related to the employment proble@@ m, we have to strengthen the employment skills training of employe@@ es.

according to the navigation need@@ s, the old W@@ an@@ f@@ u River channel takes the mode of conserv@@ ation and transform@@ ation. dre@@ dg@@ ing was conducted on the local depth and cur@@ ve cut@@ -@@ off on the local shar@@ p b@@ end. then the navigation conditions can be impro@@ ved.
the channel flow@@ s through Jin@@ xi@@ ang Coun@@ ty, Ren@@ ch@@ eng area and then through the N@@ any@@ ang Lake into the Beij@@ ing-@@ Hangzhou Grand Can@@ al main chann@@ el, with a total length of 19 k@@ m.
the renov@@ ation project of the two water@@ way started construction in February 201@@ 1. the delivery inspection was conducted in January 201@@ 5. the investment construction and operation main body is J@@ ining City An@@ ping Can@@ al Logistics Service Center@@ .
in accordance with the "@@ lo@@ an construction and charg@@ ing for re@@ paying lo@@ an@@ " princip@@ le, J@@ ining City An@@ ping Can@@ al Logistics Service Center will collect channel tol@@ ls according to the charge standard approved by Sh@@ and@@ ong Prov@@ in@@ cial Price B@@ ure@@ au@@ .
among them, the basic tol@@ l is 1.@@ 75 yuan / d@@ w@@ t and mil@@ e@@ age tol@@ l is 0.@@ 0@@ 5 yuan / km d@@ w@@ t.
the tol@@ l collection date is from June 15, 2016 to June 14, 201@@ 9.
re@@ por@@ ters learned from J@@ ining Port and Water@@ way B@@ ure@@ au that there are a total of 4 tol@@ l channels within J@@ ining territ@@ or@@ y, including Z@@ hus@@ hu@@ i@@ he Chann@@ el, B@@ aim@@ a River Chann@@ el, Be@@ id@@ ah@@ ang Ch@@ annel and La@@ ow@@ an@@ f@@ u Chann@@ el.
these four channels are Beij@@ ing-@@ Hangzhou Grand Can@@ al tri@@ but@@ ary chann@@ els, which are upgrad@@ ed and renov@@ ated in the way of social fin@@ anc@@ ing.

the funds al@@ located by the state fin@@ ance cannot meet the needs of the project construction and re@@ strict the progress of the channel upgrad@@ e.
social funds for the construction of public infrastructure are in line with national policy requirements and have become a way to break the bott@@ l@@ en@@ ec@@ k of fun@@ d@@ ing.
N@@ ing Z@@ et@@ ao@@ 's performance in the 100 meters fre@@ esty@@ le semi-@@ final has made a lot of Chinese audi@@ ence spe@@ ech@@ l@@ ess.
actu@@ ally, this 50@@ -@@ me@@ ter fre@@ esty@@ le is not the subject of N@@ ing Z@@ et@@ a@@ o. his performance and best achiev@@ ement in Kaz@@ an World Champ@@ ion@@ ships also indicate it is not possible for him to make break@@ through in this projec@@ t.
sure enough@@ , T@@ a K@@ ung Pa@@ o, an author@@ it@@ ative media in Hong Kong, reve@@ aled that the biggest reason for N@@ ing Z@@ et@@ ao to lose is that he has lost interest in sw@@ imm@@ ing.
many factors may have a great impact on his future ide@@ as. he is now more interested in entering the entertainment circ@@ le.
after Kaz@@ an World Champ@@ ion@@ ship@@ s, N@@ ing Z@@ et@@ ao inst@@ antly become celebr@@ ity with his good look and excellent performance.
as a result, "@@ national husband (@@ a good mat@@ ch@@ )@@ ," "@@ fresh little me@@ at@@ ," "@@ gor@@ ge@@ ous@@ ," etc. have become his lab@@ el.
a variety of business activities came to him. he really have a gol@@ den fl@@ ash@@ ing pro@@ spec@@ t.
in this case, that N@@ ing Z@@ et@@ ao choo@@ ses to with@@ draw and jo@@ ins the entertainment circ@@ le, is not only his freed@@ om, but also a seem@@ ingly vi@@ able way.
after all, he is only 23 years ol@@ d. after a certain degree of stud@@ y, he can perform some TV series with his popul@@ ar@@ ity.
but N@@ ing Z@@ et@@ ao needs to see whether he is qualified enough compared with his pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ ors.
at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Gam@@ es, the already 2@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old Li@@ u X@@ u@@ an came to the end of ath@@ le@@ te care@@ er.
the beautiful appearance of Li@@ u X@@ u@@ an makes her quickly remember@@ ed and also l@@ ays a foundation for her to join the entertainment circ@@ le.
after re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment, Li@@ u X@@ u@@ an star@@ red in a number of TV seri@@ es, and in 2013 she set up her own studi@@ o.
T@@ ian Li@@ ang particip@@ ated in the single and double ten@@ -@@ me@@ ter match of two Olympic Gam@@ es, and won 2 gold and 2 sil@@ ver.
but when he was de@@ fe@@ ated by his counter@@ part H@@ u J@@ ia at the single 10-@@ me@@ ter match in the 2004 Olympic Gam@@ es, T@@ ian Li@@ ang@@ 's competitive state sli@@ pped and it was said he was dis@@ mis@@ sed by the di@@ ving team@@ .
but when he took along his daughter to participate in the variety show "@@ D@@ ad, Where Are We Go@@ ing@@ ?@@ ," he became a foc@@ us.
the once gold generation Y@@ ang Wei@@ , Li Xi@@ a@@ open@@ g and Ch@@ en Y@@ i@@ bing all particip@@ ated in a variety of variety show@@ .
it is worth men@@ tion@@ ing that, Y@@ ang We@@ i and Li Xi@@ a@@ open@@ g led the Chinese team and won champ@@ ion in the 2008 Olympic Games men@@ 's team@@ . Y@@ ang We@@ i even got his individual all-@@ around gold med@@ al twice and was called as the Al@@ migh@@ ty K@@ ing.
and Ch@@ en Y@@ i@@ bing has become a ring king while leading his team to win the champ@@ ion in the 2012 Olympic Games men@@ 's team@@ .
but after he was mis@@ judg@@ ed and lost the gold in the London Olympic Gam@@ es, his mag@@ n@@ anim@@ ous act won him so many fun@@ s.
however, these game players mainly focus on the venue, they just touch and then go at the variety show@@ .
however, no matter whether they are re@@ ti@@ red or active ath@@ le@@ tes, they need to provide outstanding performance to win in the entertainment circ@@ le.
after all, ath@@ le@@ tes have just ste@@ pped into a new area, so it is just a space state for them in case of capabilities and connec@@ tion.
even for T@@ ian Li@@ ang and Li@@ u X@@ u@@ an, who are not new in the entertainment circ@@ le, common people always think of their performance at the Olympic Games when men@@ tion@@ ing them.
and the introduction of Y@@ ang We@@ i and Li Xi@@ a@@ open@@ g at the variety show is always Olympic Games Champ@@ ion.
compared with these people, N@@ ing Z@@ et@@ ao is slightly weak@@ er for the title of Sw@@ imming World Champ@@ ion@@ ship@@ s.
compared with these people, the title of N@@ ing Z@@ et@@ a@@ o, a swimming world champ@@ ion@@ ship, is not so gre@@ at.
more@@ over, compared with the withdraw@@ al of T@@ ian Li@@ ang, Li@@ u X@@ u@@ an and Y@@ ang Wei@@ , etc. at their pe@@ ak@@ s, the withdraw@@ al of N@@ ing Z@@ et@@ ao at 23 after some set@@ back would cause im@@ meas@@ ur@@ able effects to the negative influence of his imag@@ e.
after all, at the men@@ tion of ath@@ le@@ tes, people's requirements on ath@@ le@@ tes are "@@ not seeking vic@@ tory but for no fear of dang@@ er@@ ." N@@ ing Z@@ et@@ ao l@@ ags far behind from this poin@@ t.
at the very le@@ ast, N@@ ing Z@@ et@@ ao can totally rely on his great looks to win the support of thousands of huge f@@ ans.
it is a lot more difficult to be famous in the entertainment circ@@ le by just rel@@ ying on good appearance than train@@ ing.
you have to listen to your inner voice on your life path@@ . but as for how to choo@@ se, N@@ ing Z@@ et@@ ao should be quite consci@@ ous.
on the sur@@ face, the online social platform exp@@ ands our social circ@@ le and reduces people's l@@ on@@ elin@@ ess.
the sp@@ here of influence of social networking not only re@@ places the traditional telephone contac@@ t, but also gets down to the off@@ line living circ@@ le, qui@@ et@@ ly changing the current social life of the people.
the benefits of online social network are ob@@ vi@@ ous, convenient and qu@@ ick, so it is particularly vulner@@ able to the fav@@ or of young people.
a surve@@ y of college stud@@ ent@@ s' social hab@@ its shows that 57@@ % of college students spend more than 5 hours on mobile phone and is almost in@@ separ@@ able to his mobile phone during their daily liv@@ es.
"@@ social network features low co@@ st, fast transmission speed and simul@@ tane@@ ous communication among several people. this me@@ ets the require@@ ment of modern college stud@@ ent@@ s."
expanding the inter@@ personal relationship circ@@ le, more equal di@@ alogu@@ e, avo@@ iding social concer@@ ns are major reasons for us to be fas@@ cin@@ ated with online ch@@ at.
new com@@ ers in the company love online exchange with col@@ leagu@@ es. "@@ we are not familiar with each other when we just come to the company. the li@@ kes and comments on social platform makes people much closer to one an@@ other@@ ."
people who love to make friends also love online communic@@ ation. "I lost contact with my friends due to some mis@@ understand@@ ings. we became familiar again after a few di@@ alogu@@ es on the group ch@@ att@@ ing@@ ."
it engine@@ er W@@ u Y@@ an is a pro@@ found social networking lo@@ ver@@ s. his majority social life occur@@ red online and his online contact is several times than that of off@@ line friend@@ s.
W@@ u Y@@ an himself ad@@ mitted that the network is more "@@ in his ele@@ ment@@ ."
"@@ you can respond to your friends when you are will@@ ing, because there is a lot of time to think over the words and you can express it more clear@@ ly.
"the communication hidden below one's ID can avoid inter@@ personal cl@@ ash@@ . this not only has room for man@@ eu@@ ver, and even gives each other more time and space to thought and de@@ ed@@ s."
"@@ people of different identi@@ ties have the same rights and efficiency to spe@@ ech@@ . various social concer@@ ns during real life may be elimin@@ ated immediately on inter@@ net@@ ."
however, Xi@@ a@@ op@@ eng@@ , a friend of W@@ u Y@@ an, thought that W@@ u Y@@ an is a "@@ very bor@@ ing o@@ tak@@ u@@ ."
Xi@@ a@@ open@@ g and Wu@@ y@@ an meet each other in the group ch@@ att@@ ing. they two get familiar with each other because they are active speak@@ ers.
Xi@@ a@@ open@@ g thought that Wu@@ y@@ an is quite different from the one on inter@@ net@@ . he is quite bo@@ red and does not take the initi@@ ative to express his view@@ s. his words are repe@@ ated like this, "Oh, y@@ es, right@@ ," or "I will check it on@@ lin@@ e."
Ling@@ shu@@ i police has been involved in the investig@@ ation while Ling@@ shu@@ i traffic sector will also inten@@ si@@ fy efforts to rec@@ ti@@ fy illegal operation of vehic@@ les.
"the conflict on August 4 has not yet obtained investig@@ ation results. around 0 o@@ '@@ c@@ lock on August 11, the taxi of another two drivers was sm@@ ash@@ ed in the resid@@ enc@@ e."
"@@ now the tric@@ ycle is mostly and il@@ leg@@ ally operated at night. we hope the competent authorities can also inten@@ si@@ fy efforts to carry out renov@@ ation@@ ."
journ@@ al@@ ists from N@@ an@@ ha@@ i website learned from the Ling@@ shu@@ i Li Aut@@ onomous County Public Security B@@ ure@@ au that, the police have now accepted these two cas@@ es. the reasons for the two cases, who did it and whether they are related and so on still need further investig@@ ation.

this method had previously been used to determine the age of wh@@ al@@ es, but it is the first time to be used to determine the age of shar@@ ks and other fish@@ .
their analysis showed that the life sp@@ an of the largest shar@@ k is estimated at 39@@ 2 years old, with the error of 120 years ol@@ d.
that is to say, this shar@@ k is aged at least 27@@ 2 years ol@@ d. the maximum age may be 5@@ 12 years ol@@ d.
in addition, the female Green@@ land shar@@ k is alleg@@ ed to be sex@@ ually mat@@ ured at about 4 meters in leng@@ th. that is, it can only reach ad@@ ul@@ th@@ ood at least until the age of 15@@ 6.
the research@@ ers thus wrote in the paper that the Green@@ land shar@@ k was known as the ver@@ te@@ br@@ ate with the long@@ est life sp@@ an on the Ear@@ th, sur@@ pass@@ ing the age of the previous long@@ ev@@ ity champ@@ ion black right wh@@ ale (@@ 2@@ 11 year@@ s).
over the past year, the exchange reform results are signific@@ ant, with R@@ MB exchange rate remaining bas@@ ically st@@ able, but also lay@@ ing foundation for promoting the internation@@ alization of the R@@ MB@@ .
from the point of market performance, over the past year, the two-@@ way flo@@ ating characteristics of R@@ MB exchange rate is out@@ stand@@ ing. the el@@ as@@ tic@@ ity of exchange is expected to be streng@@ then@@ ed and the exchange rate is expected to be generally st@@ able.
ever since the exchange re@@ form, the fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ation of R@@ MB against the US dol@@ lar often appear@@ s, with up@@ s and down@@ s during the process.
last year, the last re@@ mit@@ tance measure before "@@ 8.@@ 11@@ " exchange reform was carried out in 200@@ 5. the appreci@@ ation of yuan against dol@@ lar was significant during the last 10 years.
since the implementation of the new exchange re@@ form, the previous appreci@@ ation state of R@@ MB was chang@@ ed. the central par@@ ity rate of R@@ MB exchange rate in one year was about 8@@ %.
this October 1, the International Mon@@ etary Fund will offici@@ ally accept the yu@@ an, which will become SD@@ R weight curren@@ c@@ y.
this wee@@ k, China's General Administration of Custom@@ s released statistics show that the first 7 months of this year, China's import and export value of 13@@ .@@ 21 tr@@ il@@ lion yu@@ an, down 3@@ % over the same period last year.
in J@@ ul@@ y, China's total import and export value fell by only 0.@@ 9@@ % year on year. in particul@@ ar, China's export value had a year-@@ on-@@ year rise of 2.@@ 9@@ %.
relevant experts believed that despite the signs of st@@ abil@@ ization in J@@ ul@@ y, we should not have high expect@@ ations.
in J@@ ul@@ y, China's total import and export valu@@ ed 2.@@ 0@@ 9 tr@@ il@@ lion yu@@ an, a year-@@ on-@@ year fall of 0.@@ 9@@ %.
among them, the export was valu@@ ed 1.@@ 22 tr@@ il@@ lion yu@@ an, up 2.@@ 9@@ %@@ ; the import was valu@@ ed 87@@ 3 billion yu@@ an, down 5.@@ 7@@ %@@ ; trade sur@@ plus was valu@@ ed 34@@ 2.@@ 8 billion yu@@ an, an increase of 34@@ %.
although the total value of im@@ ports and ex@@ ports fell year on year, the export data enjoyed grow@@ th. this is the fif@@ th con@@ secu@@ tive month for export to achieve growth since March this year.

in late Aug@@ ust, Japanese Prime Minister Sh@@ in@@ z@@ o A@@ be will go to K@@ en@@ ya to atten@@ d the 6@@ th African Development Con@@ fer@@ ence, according to the E@@ ven@@ ing News Pe@@ ak of Vo@@ ice of China.
the African Development Conference was domin@@ ated by Jap@@ an, and the previous five meet@@ ings were held in Toky@@ o, Japan or Yo@@ ko@@ ham@@ a, so this meeting will be the first move to Africa.
Japanese Foreign Ministry offici@@ als said the meeting held in Africa will help to at@@ tract atten@@ tions of African and European countries to Japan@@ .
in line with the trip of Sh@@ in@@ z@@ o Ab@@ e, according to Ky@@ o@@ do news ag@@ ency, the Japanese Liber@@ al Democr@@ ats will send par@@ li@@ am@@ ent@@ ary groups to the countries concer@@ ned.
Japan@@ 's "@@ application to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Counc@@ il@@ " began in the early 90@@ s of the last century while the Afric@@ an-@@ spon@@ so@@ red African Development Conference also began in 199@@ 3. this is not a co@@ incid@@ ence.
Africa has 53 se@@ ats in the United Nations and is therefore an important ticket bun@@ ker of the United N@@ ation. how can Japan give up Africa if it wanted to join the United Nations Security Counc@@ il@@ ?
it will also exchange views with national st@@ ake@@ holders on the extreme organization of "@@ Islam@@ ic State@@ " and terror@@ ist activities.
"@@ Western Group@@ " will visit seven countries, including Si@@ er@@ ra Le@@ one, Li@@ b@@ eria and Guine@@ a Bis@@ s@@ au@@ .
F@@ um@@ io K@@ ish@@ id@@ a, the current Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan has also recently stated the inten@@ tions of the African Development Conference at the UN Security Counc@@ il.
A@@ be has announced here that in order to st@@ abil@@ ize the stability of sub-@@ S@@ ah@@ ar@@ an African countries, it will provide 100 billion y@@ en (@@ about R@@ MB 6.@@ 1 billi@@ on@@ ) in five years.
ob@@ servers generally believe that there are two purposes behind Japan@@ 's gener@@ os@@ ity toward Afric@@ a: first, to increase Japan@@ 's presence in Afric@@ a@@ ; secon@@ d, to win the support of African countries on the application to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Counc@@ il.
"@@ in terms of poli@@ tics, Africa is relatively l@@ agg@@ ing beh@@ ind@@ , but there are many African countries. so Japan has always regard@@ ed it as the so@@ -@@ called '@@ big ticket fiel@@ d@@ ,@@ '@@ " said Y@@ ang BO@@ J@@ I@@ AN@@ G, an expert for Japanese issu@@ es.
Japan will not give up in the future and its work on Africa will not be termin@@ ated but grad@@ ually streng@@ then@@ ed.
econom@@ ic@@ ally, Japan enjo@@ ys a strong production capac@@ ity, but its domestic market is relatively limi@@ ted. in particul@@ ar, the domestic demand is relatively we@@ ak in the context of aging popul@@ ation.
however, from J@@ unic@@ h@@ iro Ko@@ iz@@ um@@ i, who was Japan@@ 's pri@@ me min@@ ister 10 years ago, to the present Ab@@ e, Japan has repe@@ ated@@ ly launched the "@@ spr@@ int@@ " sch@@ em@@ e. however, all sch@@ em@@ es were ab@@ and@@ oned event@@ u@@ ally.
Y@@ ang BO@@ J@@ I@@ ANG believed that the inten@@ sion of Japan to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council is be clear at a gl@@ ance. however, the road is bound to be full of ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les.
to achieve its own go@@ als, Japan should fir@@ st@@ ly do a good job with the surrounding countries. and Japan needs to have a correct attit@@ ude no matter in ge@@ op@@ oli@@ tical competition or in the national dispute or understanding of a historical problem.

they said, although there are similar f@@ esti@@ vi@@ ties comm@@ em@@ or@@ ating the anc@@ est@@ ors, the atmosphere is quite so@@ le@@ m@@ n. but here you can enjoy music, food and also can learn traditional craf@@ t.
she said, "It is quite pleasant to see siz@@ able and organized anc@@ est@@ or wor@@ ship cerem@@ ony in such a busy financial met@@ ropol@@ is of Hong K@@ ong@@ ."
"@@ this not only em@@ bodies the di@@ vers@@ ity of Chinese cul@@ ture, but also allows more people to understand these traditional craft and her@@ it@@ age@@ ."
"@@ we do not want to make the B@@ on Culture Festival very hor@@ ri@@ f@@ y@@ ing, which may sp@@ ook people, especially the children@@ ," said H@@ u Y@@ ans@@ ong, the chief responsible person of the event.
"@@ we hope that through the you@@ th@@ ful activities and layout of the scen@@ e, so that young people know that the culture behind the B@@ on Festival is to express the f@@ ili@@ al pi@@ ety and th@@ ank@@ s@@ gi@@ v@@ ing@@ ."
he also said that this time a total of 24 teams particip@@ ated in "@@ cli@@ mb@@ ing competi@@ tion@@ ," which is not only organized by comm@@ uni@@ ties, but also in combination with schools and attended by stud@@ ents.
it is understood that the Fed@@ eration of Hong Kong Chi@@ u C@@ how Community Organiz@@ ations is listed as "@@ national int@@ ang@@ ible cultural her@@ itage list@@ " in 201@@ 1.
on the evening of the 11@@ th day of the month, China National Pe@@ king Opera The@@ ater took its famous TV play "@@ White Sn@@ ak@@ e" and travel@@ ed thousands of miles to Mexico C@@ ity. they presented the local people with an auth@@ enti@@ c Pe@@ king Opera fe@@ ast in the Mex@@ ican National Pal@@ ace.

Zh@@ ang Q@@ i, the Prov@@ in@@ cial Stand@@ ing Committee and S@@ any@@ a Munic@@ ip@@ al Party Committee Secre@@ tar@@ y, W@@ ang Lu@@ , v@@ ice govern@@ or and L@@ u Z@@ hi@@ yu@@ an, sec@@ ret@@ ary general of prov@@ in@@ cial government particip@@ ated in the research semin@@ ar@@ s.
in the 14 years of her sports care@@ er, D@@ eng Y@@ ap@@ ing won a total of 18 world champ@@ ion@@ ship@@ s, becoming the first Chinese to win four Olympic gold med@@ als in China's Olympic histor@@ y.
she ran@@ ked first in the table tenn@@ is for 8 years to maintain the world's first and is a female ath@@ le@@ te to ran@@ k as the "the world's fir@@ st@@ " for the long@@ est time in the history of table tenn@@ is.
on September 26@@ , 201@@ 0, she served as Dep@@ uty Secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ General of People's D@@ ail@@ y, general manager of People's Search Network Co., Ltd. and the depart@@ ment@@ -@@ level c@@ ad@@ re.
rec@@ ently, she will work together with Y@@ u Min@@ h@@ ong to build the first domestic sports industry innovation and entreprene@@ ur@@ ship platform@@ .
there was also a team of star co@@ aches in the Chinese sports circ@@ le. they were gor@@ ge@@ ous in the era of ath@@ le@@ tes and won coun@@ t@@ less glory for the country. after re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment, they passed what they learned to the new com@@ ers and cultiv@@ ated a great number of champ@@ ion@@ s.
as the first world champ@@ ion in Chinese men@@ 's g@@ ym@@ n@@ as@@ tics, Hu@@ ang Y@@ ub@@ in cho@@ se to pick up the poin@@ ter after re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment.
from the wom@@ en@@ 's team co@@ ach to the men@@ 's team co@@ ach, to the head co@@ ach, Hu@@ ang Y@@ ub@@ in created an "@@ Olympic gold group@@ ," and led to win 9 gol@@ d, 1 silver and 4 cop@@ per at the Beijing Olympic Gam@@ es.
since then, T@@ ian Li@@ ang has been experienc@@ ing advertising endor@@ se@@ ment. he has even served as a "@@ Co@@ wher@@ d@@ ," "@@ Le@@ i F@@ eng@@ " and other important ro@@ les in recent years.
many N@@ B@@ A players have proved their streng@@ th. but when@@ ever there is progres@@ s, there is dec@@ line.
whether it is because of the increase in age or limited playing time, some players will have reg@@ res@@ sive performance each seas@@ on.
of course, some "@@ re@@ treat@@ " may only be data sh@@ r@@ in@@ k, but the strength of these players may not have been reduc@@ ed.
even if W@@ ade is still one of the leagu@@ e's best line@@ back@@ er, his performance in the Bul@@ ls is not so good as that of the He@@ at.
the back@@ court range of he and Lon@@ do is limi@@ ted. the three-@@ point hit rate of head@@ ed star But@@ ler is just 3@@ 2.@@ 8@@ %, making their nex@@ t-@@ season off@@ ence quite challeng@@ ing.
after coming to F@@ eng Cheng@@ , the Red Star will definitely give the ball right to But@@ ler and Ron@@ do and he himself choose to play healthy in the regular seas@@ on.
O@@ ka@@ for@@ 's situation is more embar@@ r@@ ass@@ ing. as the first choice of 7@@ 6 people last seas@@ on, he had to comp@@ ete for playing time and ball right with Sim@@ mon@@ s and en@@ by in the new seas@@ on.
this competition may not come so@@ on. Sim@@ mon@@ s also need to adap@@ t to the N@@ B@@ A st@@ adi@@ um, and En@@ b@@ i must also be fully recover@@ ed from the injury as soon as possib@@ le, but whether O@@ ka@@ for can have a position in the long array of 7@@ 6 people.
last seas@@ on, 32@@ % of the score of O@@ ka@@ for comes from the low attack@@ . such rate is higher than C@@ ous@@ in@@ s, Wu@@ ch@@ ev@@ ich and Bro@@ ok L@@ op@@ ez@@ , while his use rate is also the top 40 in the leagu@@ e.
with Sim@@ mon@@ s already showing a good poin@@ t-@@ forward po@@ ten@@ tion, En@@ b@@ i also has a better st@@ ature more suitable for N@@ B@@ A games and O@@ ka@@ for@@ 's position is hard to be so solid@@ .
over the past two seas@@ ons, Thom@@ p@@ son@@ 's use rate has st@@ abil@@ ized in the top 20 of the le@@ ague and this is the best two seas@@ ons for his care@@ er.
but the problem is, with the arrival of D@@ ur@@ ant, Thom@@ p@@ son@@ 's appearance rati@@ o will su@@ rely dec@@ line, which is bound to affect his pl@@ ay.
this effect will not only be the impact of the number of sho@@ ts, Thom@@ p@@ son@@ 's holding attack in the next season will certainly be great@@ ly reduc@@ ed, which in some ways will reduce the op@@ pon@@ ent@@ 's defense diffic@@ ult@@ y.
D@@ ur@@ ant@@ 's arrival will certainly neg@@ atively affect the score of War@@ ri@@ ors play@@ ers, but the one with the most negative effect is probably that of Thom@@ p@@ son@@ .
but this does not mean that the level of Thom@@ p@@ son steps back@@ w@@ ard. this is more likely that he made sacri@@ f@@ ice for the team as a who@@ le.
Par@@ ker had a better performance than last seas@@ on. this is not only because his bas@@ ket efficiency came to the highest level, his chemical re@@ action with Al@@ dr@@ ich also benefits the Sp@@ ur@@ s.
D@@ un@@ can re@@ ti@@ red, G@@ in@@ ob@@ il@@ i announced a second batt@@ les for a year and the combination of GD@@ P event@@ ually came to an end. as one of the youn@@ gest among three people, the oil tank of French sports car is not much left.
after getting the third champ@@ ion@@ ship r@@ ing, only J@@ ab@@ bar, Jord@@ an and Rus@@ sell won more regular M@@ V@@ P than that of Jam@@ es, while Jord@@ an was the only one who had more F@@ M@@ V@@ P than that of Jam@@ es.
Oh, y@@ es, James has just brought the first professional sports champ@@ ion@@ ship tro@@ ph@@ y in C@@ level@@ and in the past 52 years.
coming to the 14@@ th season of his care@@ er, James needs to better con@@ serve his strength and get ready for the play@@ off@@ s.
therefore, in the regular seas@@ on, Jam@@ es@@ 's cap@@ ability is likely to further dec@@ line, he will give more weight to Ow@@ en to be@@ ar, but he will still easily become the leagu@@ e's top three play@@ ers.
"I must carry forward what I learned in China to apply to Russi@@ a@@ ."
on the 12@@ th day of the month of the local time, Hu@@ ang J@@ ing, ch@@ air@@ man of the Moscow Over@@ seas Chinese Association said exci@@ ted@@ ly while she saw the re@@ por@@ ter of Chin@@ an@@ ew@@ s.@@ com@@ .
not long ago, she particip@@ ated in the "@@ overseas Chinese culture community Chinese talent (@@ cal@@ li@@ graph@@ y, pain@@ t@@ ing) train@@ ing@@ " hos@@ ted by Chinese State Council Over@@ seas Chinese Affairs Office and spon@@ so@@ red by Jin@@ an Univers@@ ity.
while particip@@ ating in the training course just now, she did not know where to start in painting and cal@@ li@@ graph@@ y. as a result, after the end of the course, she has been able to draw and write her own work@@ s.
after retur@@ ning back to Mo@@ sc@@ ow, I will use the knowledge and skills learned in China to Russia and make my own contribution for the cultural transmission and promotion of the Chinese cul@@ ture.
at the same time, N@@ a Y@@ an@@ we@@ i, the Secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ General of Russi@@ an-@@ Chinese Culture Pro@@ motion Association who also particip@@ ated in this training course had the same feel@@ ing.
she said that she made great progress with the help of teach@@ ers of the training classes and she felt the heavy responsibility of being the "@@ overseas communic@@ ator of Chinese cul@@ ture@@ "
she said, after she came back to Russi@@ a, she would su@@ rely carry out the traditional Chinese culture among the Chinese and the Russi@@ ans who love Chinese cul@@ ture.

Brit@@ ain set@@ tle for silver in ru@@ g@@ by se@@ ven@@ s after Fi@@ ji master@@ class sees them take gold
great Brit@@ ain@@ 's impres@@ sive run in the R@@ ug@@ by 7@@ s was brought to a cr@@ ash@@ ing hal@@ t at the final hur@@ d@@ le by Fi@@ ji in the final on Th@@ urs@@ day night when they were compre@@ hen@@ si@@ vely be@@ ate@@ n 4@@ 3-@@ 7 at the De@@ od@@ or@@ o Sta@@ dium here in Ri@@ o.
Fi@@ ji gave a master@@ class in hand@@ l@@ ing, off@@ -@@ load@@ ing, si@@ de-@@ ste@@ pp@@ ing, support play, running lines and br@@ ute strength to win gold - their first Olympic med@@ al of any col@@ our@@ .
de@@ fe@@ at came with the non-@@ too sh@@ ab@@ by con@@ sol@@ ation of silver - Brit@@ ain@@ 's third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the in@@ aug@@ ural Olympic 7@@ s tour@@ nam@@ ent in which they beat New Zeal@@ and, Argent@@ ina and South Africa along the way.
the br@@ u@@ ising be@@ ating of the Bo@@ ks, 7-@@ 5 in the semi-@@ final earlier in the day, may have come back to b@@ ite them in the fin@@ al.
bu@@ t, regard@@ l@@ ess, Fi@@ ji on this form would have be@@ ate@@ n a fit as a f@@ iddle 15-@@ man team@@ .
it may be some con@@ sol@@ ation to GB - but probably not - that at least one Brit@@ on will have a gold med@@ al around his nec@@ k tomor@@ row@@ : Fi@@ ji@@ 's head co@@ ach is Ben R@@ y@@ an, the former England bo@@ ss from W@@ im@@ ble@@ don@@ .
it has been some journey for GB@@ .
eight years ago, under R@@ y@@ an, they lost every game at the Ad@@ el@@ a@@ ide S@@ even@@ s.
here, they lost just one.
this ham@@ mer@@ ing will hur@@ t but the progress is start@@ l@@ ing.
Fi@@ ji started mag@@ nific@@ ently, b@@ ounc@@ ing off GB t@@ ack@@ les for fun@@ .
it was like running into a series of moving b@@ uses for cap@@ tain T@@ om M@@ itch@@ ell and co and the World Series champ@@ ions went 5-@@ 0 up when O@@ sea K@@ ol@@ in@@ is@@ au di@@ ved over in the cor@@ ner.
with four minutes on the c@@ lock Jer@@ ry Tu@@ w@@ ai added another down the right w@@ ing, which was conver@@ ted.
12-@@ 0 and GB had hard@@ ly touched the b@@ all.
a super@@ b M@@ itch@@ ell t@@ ack@@ le stopped the man@@ -@@ mountain Le@@ one N@@ ak@@ ar@@ aw@@ a from sc@@ oring a third but it was only del@@ ay@@ ing Fi@@ ji@@ .
on seven minutes J@@ as@@ a Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a touched down in the right corner and GB were 17@@ -@@ 0 to the b@@ ad.
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ aw@@ a added another from the rest@@ art and there was still over a minute on the cloc@@ k@@ ... in the first hal@@ f@@ .
V@@ ate@@ mo R@@ av@@ ou@@ v@@ ou then bur@@ st through some more lim@@ p GB t@@ ack@@ ling and stor@@ med to the line to sco@@ re.
the conversion made it 29@@ -@@ 0 at the break@@ .
it was as if Fi@@ ji had been born to play 7@@ s, while GB are still learning the trad@@ e.
which is pretty much how it is.
GB made wh@@ oles@@ ale changes at hal@@ f@@ -time and they pl@@ u@@ gged the Fi@@ j@@ ian dam@@ ... for all of four minute@@ s, which by fir@@ st-@@ half standards was good, until Jo@@ su@@ a Tu@@ is@@ ov@@ a went over after some br@@ illi@@ ant Fi@@ j@@ ian inter@@ pl@@ ay.
D@@ an Nor@@ ton gr@@ ab@@ bed a try for G@@ B, tou@@ ching down in the left corner to make it 36@@ -@@ 7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Is@@ land@@ ers whose f@@ ans s@@ ang, wav@@ ed fl@@ ags and d@@ anced in the stand@@ s.
it was hard not to ad@@ m@@ ire Fi@@ ji@@ 's whole jo@@ y@@ ful appro@@ ach.
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame ic@@ ed the Fi@@ j@@ ian ca@@ ke that didn't need ic@@ ing with another try in the d@@ ying mom@@ ents.
the wh@@ ist@@ le w@@ ent, the Fi@@ ji@@ ans embr@@ ac@@ ed and GB hit the tur@@ f, thor@@ ough@@ ly be@@ aten@@ .
earlier in the day, Fi@@ ji had be@@ ate@@ n Japan 20@@ -@@ 5 in their semi-@@ final and GB ed@@ g@@ ed South Africa in a ti@@ ght semi-@@ final of one try each - Brit@@ ain@@ 's conversion the differ@@ ence.
Ky@@ le Brow@@ n put the Bo@@ ks ahead in the first half but D@@ an Nor@@ ton with some d@@ azz@@ ling foot@@ work broke the line and sco@@ red under the posts in the second hal@@ f@@ .
a br@@ illi@@ ant late t@@ ack@@ le from Mar@@ c@@ us Wat@@ son, brother of Eng@@ land@@ 's 15-@@ as@@ ide te@@ am, An@@ th@@ on@@ y, sec@@ ured the win - and ul@@ ti@@ mately the silver med@@ al.
Hel@@ en G@@ lo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired to row@@ ing vic@@ tory by co@@ ach@@ 's cancer b@@ attle
there will not be a more em@@ otive gold at these gam@@ es, and that is saying some@@ thing.
from the first stro@@ ke to the la@@ st, 2@@ 20 pun@@ ishing heav@@ es into history, Hel@@ en G@@ lo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found added meaning in their gol@@ den moment at the Est@@ aci@@ o da L@@ ago@@ a.
though they were the two pul@@ ling on the o@@ ar@@ s, there were three vo@@ ices in that bo@@ at, the ech@@ o of co@@ ach Rob@@ in Willi@@ ams ever present as they pow@@ ered to a second succ@@ es@@ sive Olympic gold in the wom@@ en@@ 's p@@ air@@ s, the first fem@@ al@@ es in the ann@@ als of British s@@ port to scale such a he@@ igh@@ t.
their domin@@ ance was absolu@@ te, after all this was their 39@@ th ou@@ ting un@@ be@@ ate@@ n, again un@@ prec@@ ed@@ en@@ ted.
what we see, two br@@ illi@@ ant ath@@ le@@ tes sk@@ ating over the surface with the eleg@@ ance of sw@@ ans, does not wh@@ ol@@ ly reflect the nature of the tri@@ um@@ ph@@ .
behind every row@@ ing gold is a batt@@ ali@@ on of w@@ illing hands contribu@@ ting the incre@@ mental g@@ ains that make the differ@@ ence, and no hands were more instru@@ mental than those of a co@@ ach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagno@@ sed with canc@@ er.
as he said, it was touch and go.
I had bl@@ ad@@ der cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they di@@ d.
if they don't it goes every@@ wher@@ e.
it would have been a pretty bad situ@@ ation.
it al@@ ters your out@@ look a b@@ it.
Willi@@ ams was diagno@@ sed in December 201@@ 3.
the tri@@ o were fortun@@ ate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of seas@@ on, keeping the dis@@ rup@@ tion to a minim@@ um, if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as thes@@ e.
I needed to get paid so I had to get better quick@@ ly.
it was an inc@@ enti@@ ve.
I was in hosp@@ ital and I was walking around the ward - 20@@ f@@ t, 30@@ ft 50@@ ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough@@ .
that's how it starts off@@ .
row@@ ing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit big@@ g@@ er.
in the immedi@@ acy of vic@@ tory their first thou@@ ghts were for Willi@@ am@@ s, who had spent a n@@ erv@@ y morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to process his own anxi@@ e@@ ties.
St@@ ann@@ ing, a cap@@ tain in the Royal Ar@@ till@@ ery regi@@ ment with a tour of Afgh@@ an@@ istan behind her, said "@@ I've been an emo@@ tional w@@ rec@@ k this wee@@ k, may@@ be that's a bit extre@@ me, but it means such a lot@@ ."
it just re@@ iter@@ ates how much this means to me, how much me and Hel@@ en have worked and Rob@@ in as well.
it's been a fant@@ astic three years back with Hel@@ en and Rob@@ in.
without Rob@@ in we would be no@@ body, so a mas@@ sive thanks to him he's the best co@@ ach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better person to train with, or a better co@@ ach.
Hel@@ en G@@ lo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning haven@@ 't lost a race in five years.
the pair set a pun@@ ishing r@@ hy@@ th@@ m that their riv@@ als could never mat@@ ch.
even in the final 500 metres when the cre@@ w@@ s from New Zealand and Den@@ mark began to clo@@ se, St@@ anning and G@@ lo@@ ver had too much in reserv@@ e.
we were very much in the moment.
Hel@@ en was calling '@@ stay in the process, stay in the process@@ '@@ .
it's really important not to get carried away.
we had a good start and at the same time we wer@@ en@@ 't looking to do anything amaz@@ ing.
we wer@@ en@@ 't looking for fire@@ works to@@ day, we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that r@@ ace, which we di@@ d.
the pair will take a year before decid@@ ing their fut@@ ures.
G@@ lo@@ ver has a wedding to atten@@ d next month, her own to television advent@@ ure@@ r Ste@@ ve back@@ Sh@@ all.
for now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last r@@ ace.
that would have meant too much pressu@@ re.
in London it took about six months to real@@ ise that I was an Olympic champ@@ ion.
it was all so new and I was so stres@@ s@@ ed.
here it took about four minutes.
this fe@@ els so much bet@@ ter, "@@ she said.

Sn@@ ap@@ chat "@@ Anim@@ e" Eff@@ ect Is Cri@@ tic@@ ized as Asian Car@@ ic@@ ature
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says this filter is inspired by anim@@ e, but some ob@@ servers say it's r@@ aci@@ ally in@@ sensi@@ tive.
with its l@@ ens to@@ ol, Sn@@ ap@@ chat allows some 150 million daily users to al@@ ter reality and play with identi@@ ty in ways that border on the ab@@ sur@@ d.
you can turn yourself into a p@@ ine@@ app@@ le, a do@@ g or a character be@@ fit@@ ting a Ro@@ y L@@ ich@@ ten@@ ste@@ in pain@@ t@@ ing.
the l@@ enses are bl@@ un@@ t, feat@@ ure@@ -@@ war@@ ping tools that generate more than 30 million enh@@ anced sel@@ fies a day.
any mis@@ steps quickly enter the public record@@ .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat l@@ enses have draw@@ n critic@@ ism in the past with acc@@ us@@ ations that the app was promoting black@@ face or encour@@ aging wh@@ i@@ ten@@ ed skin ton@@ es as an ideal of be@@ aut@@ y.
so when it pushed a l@@ ens to some users this week that gave them sl@@ an@@ ted eyes, di@@ stor@@ ted te@@ eth and pu@@ ff@@ y che@@ e@@ ks, some cri@@ tics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asian people - "@@ y@@ el@@ low@@ fac@@ e."
and they wonder@@ ed if these repe@@ ated contro@@ versi@@ es poin@@ ted to a larger problem that the company has with di@@ vers@@ ity.
the news and the ou@@ tr@@ age went wide on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day, with reports by The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board, a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat said it had dis@@ man@@ t@@ led the feat@@ ure.
the company offered an explan@@ ation: the l@@ ens was meant as hom@@ age to anim@@ e character@@ s, not as a car@@ ic@@ ature of Asian people.
but for ob@@ servers who have experienced rac@@ ism, the l@@ ens re@@ min@@ ded them of hur@@ t@@ ful ster@@ e@@ o@@ types in action.
others r@@ ound@@ ly rejec@@ ted the anim@@ e compar@@ is@@ on.
in an email@@ , Gr@@ ace S@@ par@@ ap@@ ani@@ , a Korean American art student whose t@@ we@@ et about the photos was widely share@@ d, said that the l@@ ens was "@@ hur@@ t@@ ful and un@@ comfortable to say the le@@ ast@@ ."
she added that "@@ it's hard to ar@@ gue with the side by side compar@@ ison of the very g@@ ross Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the fil@@ ter@@ 's effec@@ ts.
it shows that the filter isn't just y@@ el@@ low@@ face, but y@@ el@@ low@@ face taken to its der@@ og@@ atory extre@@ me.
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company to cross these cultural tri@@ p@@ wi@@ res.
American culture seems involved in an end@@ less stru@@ ggle over di@@ vers@@ ity and incl@@ us@@ ion, from corporate board@@ rooms to Holly@@ wood and the devices we all carry in our hand@@ s.
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ at's huge audi@@ ence of youn@@ ger people - who are more r@@ aci@@ ally diverse than their older counter@@ parts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensi@@ tiv@@ ity.
when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ at's l@@ enses creates an image that is insul@@ ting to a us@@ er, 25@@ -@@ year-@@ old K@@ ati@@ e Zh@@ u said in an inter@@ view on Th@@ urs@@ day, "@@ it's much hard@@ er for these types of things to go un@@ noticed like they did before@@ ."
on Th@@ urs@@ day, M@@ s. Z@@ hu@@ , a product manager and engine@@ er who works for Medi@@ um, decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and encour@@ aged others to do the same.
in an ess@@ ay for Medi@@ um and in a telephone inter@@ view, she said she believed that the rac@@ e-@@ related contro@@ versi@@ es refl@@ ected a lack of di@@ vers@@ ity in h@@ iring practices at Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ at.
M@@ s. Zh@@ u critic@@ ized the company's mostly wh@@ ite, all-@@ male leadership and ended her ess@@ ay with a h@@ ash@@ tag@@ : # D@@ ele@@ te@@ Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ at.
"@@ it's either that they had no diverse represent@@ ation of people of color on their staff to the point where they're able to make decis@@ ions like this@@ ," M@@ s. Z@@ hu@@ , who is Chin@@ es@@ e-@@ Americ@@ an, said, "@@ or they do have some people of color who are working there, but they're not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up@@ ."
other ob@@ servers share her view, a complain@@ t that Sn@@ ap@@ chat has left larg@@ ely un@@ answer@@ ed.
the company does not release fig@@ ures about di@@ vers@@ ity on its staff@@ , no@@ ting its status as a private company.
on Th@@ urs@@ day, Sn@@ ap@@ chat dec@@ lined to discuss the r@@ aci@@ al back@@ grounds of its staff@@ , but according to a spo@@ k@@ es@@ man, the company recently hi@@ red a recru@@ i@@ ter to focus on under@@ represented popul@@ ations and on driving incl@@ usion efforts inter@@ n@@ ally.
for her par@@ t, M@@ s. Zh@@ u said she would keep her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account clos@@ ed, add@@ ing, "I won@@ der if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O@@ .@@ K@@ ."
military Off@@ ici@@ als Dist@@ or@@ ted IS@@ IS Intellig@@ ence, Con@@ gres@@ sion@@ al Pan@@ el S@@ ays
offici@@ als from the United States Central Comm@@ and al@@ tered intellig@@ ence reports to por@@ tr@@ ay a more optim@@ istic picture of the war against the Islam@@ ic State in I@@ ra@@ q and Sy@@ ria than events on the ground warran@@ ted, a con@@ gres@@ sion@@ al panel said in a report issued Th@@ urs@@ day.
the inter@@ im re@@ port, from a task force established by the Republic@@ an ch@@ air@@ men of the House Ar@@ med Services Commit@@ te@@ e, Intellig@@ ence Committee and Def@@ ense Ap@@ propri@@ ations Sub@@ commit@@ te@@ e, found "@@ wid@@ es@@ pre@@ ad dis@@ satisfac@@ tion@@ " among Central Comm@@ and intellig@@ ence analy@@ st@@ s, who said su@@ peri@@ ors were doc@@ tor@@ ing their assess@@ ments of American efforts to de@@ fe@@ at the Islam@@ ic State@@ .
Central Comm@@ and, known as CENT@@ CO@@ M, is the military head@@ quar@@ ters in T@@ amp@@ a, F@@ la@@ ., that over@@ sees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asi@@ a.
"@@ intellig@@ ence products approved by senior CENT@@ COM leaders typically provided a more positive dep@@ ic@@ tion of U.S. anti@@ terror@@ ism efforts than was warran@@ ted by facts on the ground and were consisten@@ tly more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intellig@@ ence commun@@ ity@@ ," a news release about the report said.
"@@ what happened at CENT@@ COM is un@@ accep@@ table - our war fi@@ gh@@ ters suff@@ er when bad analysis is presented to senior policy mak@@ ers@@ ," said Representative K@@ en Cal@@ ver@@ t, Republic@@ an of Californi@@ a.
the leadership fail@@ ures at CENT@@ COM reach to the very top of the organiz@@ ation.
the 10-@@ page report detailed per@@ s@@ istent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Comm@@ and@@ 's description and analysis of American efforts to train I@@ ra@@ qi forc@@ es.
although it offers no defini@@ tive evidence that senior Ob@@ ama administration offici@@ als ordered the reports to be doc@@ to@@ red, it descri@@ bes analy@@ sts as feeling as though they were under pressure from CENT@@ COM leaders to present a more optim@@ istic view of the thre@@ at posed by the Islam@@ ic St@@ ate, also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL@@ .
"@@ throughout the first half of 2015, many Central Comm@@ and press rele@@ as@@ es, state@@ ments and con@@ gres@@ sion@@ al testim@@ on@@ ies were significantly more positive than actual event@@ s," the report said.
for example, a CENT@@ COM official stated publicly that a major military ass@@ a@@ ult to take back Mo@@ su@@ l could begin as early as April or May 201@@ 5.
Mo@@ sul@@ , I@@ ra@@ q@@ 's second@@ -@@ largest city, remains under the control of the Islam@@ ic State@@ .
"@@ after months of investig@@ ation, this much is very clear@@ ," Representative Mi@@ ke P@@ om@@ pe@@ o, Republic@@ an of K@@ ans@@ as, said in a state@@ ment.
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States Central Comm@@ and@@ 's most senior intellig@@ ence leaders man@@ ip@@ ulated the command@@ 's intellig@@ ence products to down@@ play the thre@@ at from IS@@ IS in I@@ ra@@ q@@ .
Republic@@ ans created the task force after learning that analy@@ sts had raised concer@@ ns that intellig@@ ence about the Islam@@ ic State was being man@@ ip@@ ul@@ ated.
the report released Th@@ urs@@ day is to be followed up by more extensive find@@ ings as the investig@@ ation continu@@ es.
there is an ad@@ dition@@ al, on@@ going investig@@ ation of CENT@@ COM intellig@@ ence by the Department of Def@@ ense inspec@@ tor gener@@ al.
Democratic members of the House Intellig@@ ence Committee released their own find@@ ings on Th@@ urs@@ day that agreed with some of the concl@@ us@@ ions of the Republic@@ an task forc@@ e.
"@@ between 2014 and 2015, CENT@@ COM created an over@@ ly ins@@ ular process for produc@@ ing intellig@@ ence assess@@ ments on IS@@ I@@ L and I@@ ra@@ qi Security For@@ c@@ es@@ ," Representative Ad@@ am B@@ . S@@ chi@@ ff@@ , the commit@@ te@@ e's top Democr@@ at, said in a state@@ ment.
this process, Mr. S@@ chi@@ ff said, "@@ st@@ all@@ ed the release of intellig@@ ence produc@@ ts@@ ," hur@@ t mor@@ ale among analy@@ sts and "@@ in@@ suffici@@ ently accommod@@ ated dis@@ s@@ ent@@ ing view@@ s."
but Mr. S@@ chi@@ ff and the Democr@@ ats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure CENT@@ COM analy@@ sts to fit their concl@@ us@@ ions to a "@@ pres@@ et or political n@@ arr@@ ati@@ ve@@ ."
the pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary results of the con@@ gres@@ sion@@ al investig@@ ation were reported Tu@@ es@@ day by The D@@ aily Be@@ ast@@ .
last Aug@@ ust, The New York Times reported the existence of the P@@ ent@@ agon inspec@@ tor general investig@@ ation, opened after complain@@ ts by CENT@@ COM analy@@ st@@ s.
L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Pat@@ r@@ ick Ev@@ ans, a P@@ ent@@ agon spo@@ k@@ es@@ man, said in a statement that the Def@@ ense Department would not comment on the con@@ gres@@ sion@@ al report while the inspec@@ tor gener@@ al@@ 's investig@@ ation continu@@ ed.
but he said that "@@ experts sometimes dis@@ agree on the inter@@ pret@@ ation of complex data, and the intellig@@ ence community and Department of Def@@ ense welcome healthy di@@ alogue on these v@@ ital national security top@@ ic@@ s."
the investig@@ ation has re@@ per@@ cus@@ sions beyond the question of whether the Americ@@ an-@@ led b@@ om@@ bing campa@@ ign in I@@ ra@@ q and Sy@@ ria is succ@@ eed@@ ing (@@ an ass@@ er@@ tion now made by a growing number of Def@@ ense offici@@ al@@ s).
but last year@@ 's alleg@@ ations called into question how much President Ob@@ ama could rely on Central Comm@@ and for hon@@ est assess@@ ments of military operations in I@@ ra@@ q@@ , Afgh@@ an@@ ist@@ an, Li@@ b@@ ya and other cris@@ is spo@@ ts.
the cri@@ ti@@ ques on the Islam@@ ic State intellig@@ ence mir@@ ror disputes of more than a dec@@ ade ago, when a CENT@@ COM intellig@@ ence analy@@ st, G@@ reg@@ ory H@@ ook@@ er, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W@@ . B@@ us@@ h, over many analy@@ sts "@@ objec@@ tions, advoc@@ ated a small force in I@@ ra@@ q and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 200@@ 3 inv@@ as@@ ion.
Mr. H@@ ook@@ er also played a key part in the insur@@ rec@@ tion over the Islam@@ ic State intellig@@ ence.
last year, offici@@ als said, Mr. H@@ ook@@ er's team concl@@ uded that despite public state@@ ments to the contr@@ ary, air@@ stri@@ kes against Islam@@ ic State@@ -@@ held refin@@ eries had not significantly weak@@ ened the terror@@ ist group@@ 's fin@@ ances because it had built mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft refin@@ eries to sell oil on the black market.
but the finding was not distribu@@ ted outside Central Comm@@ and, The Times reported in Septem@@ ber.
CENT@@ COM@@ 's command@@ er then, G@@ en. L@@ loy@@ d J@@ . A@@ us@@ tin II@@ I, came under critic@@ ism last year after Sen@@ ate testim@@ ony viewed by many law@@ makers as being an over@@ ly positive assess@@ ment of the war@@ .
General A@@ us@@ tin re@@ ti@@ red in April and was re@@ placed at Central Comm@@ and by G@@ en. Joseph L@@ . Vo@@ tel@@ .

five go@@ als in two games should be a memor@@ able feat@@ , but B@@ am, 27, said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing.
"I have no cl@@ u@@ e@@ ," she said.
I'm not really one of those people who keeps track of their go@@ als.
here is what she does know@@ : the Americ@@ ans are 4-@@ 0 in the Olympic tour@@ nam@@ ent and are ti@@ ed for first place in their group with Brit@@ ain, which remained un@@ be@@ ate@@ n after de@@ fe@@ ating Jap@@ an, 2-@@ 0, on Th@@ urs@@ day.
Brit@@ ain and the United States will meet on Satur@@ day in the last game of the first r@@ oun@@ d.
both teams have qualified for the quarter fin@@ als, and the game will decide who fin@@ ishes first in their six@@ -@@ team br@@ ack@@ et and who fin@@ ishes secon@@ d.
the fir@@ st-@@ place fin@@ is@@ her will avoid the powerful D@@ ut@@ ch, the leaders of the other br@@ ack@@ et, for a bit longer when the quarter fin@@ als beg@@ in.
howe@@ ver Satur@@ day@@ 's game turns out, the Americ@@ ans have created a sti@@ r with their surpris@@ ing run here, four years after fin@@ ishing last among 12 teams at the London Gam@@ es.
B@@ AM was on that team@@ .

she mis@@ sed out on the 2008 Olymp@@ ics when she did not make the cut for the final ro@@ st@@ er.
then came 201@@ 2, when nothing much went right for her and her team@@ ma@@ tes.
the next year, Cr@@ ai@@ g Par@@ n@@ ham, an English@@ man, was named the co@@ ach, and things began to change.
"@@ a cultural change, a mental change, a physical chang@@ e@@ ," B@@ am said.
we didn't have the work rate in London that we have now.
we@@ 've made a complete tur@@ nar@@ oun@@ d.
on Th@@ urs@@ day night, B@@ am opened the sc@@ oring in the first half with a back@@ hand shot from close in.
India had come into the game without a vic@@ tory in the tour@@ nam@@ ent, but the team proved surpris@@ ingly tou@@ gh and kept the score 1-@@ 0 until late in the third perio@@ d, when B@@ am took charg@@ e.
she made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field, then cur@@ led into the middle and wh@@ ip@@ ped the ball into the goal to give the Americ@@ ans a 2-@@ 0 lead@@ .
Mel@@ is@@ sa G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ e@@ z added the final goal mid@@ way through the fourth perio@@ d.
the shut@@ out was the first of the tour@@ nam@@ ent for the United States go@@ ali@@ e, Jack@@ ie Bri@@ gg@@ s, who had allowed one goal in each of the first three vic@@ tor@@ ies.
she is on a roll@@ .
so is B@@ am@@ .
"@@ we're in a good place right now@@ ," Par@@ n@@ ham said, but just how good it is will dep@@ end on the result of Satur@@ day@@ 's game.
the Dep@@ res@@ sing Food of the Dep@@ res@@ sion, in "@@ A Square Me@@ al@@ "
in March 19@@ 33@@ , shor@@ tly after asc@@ ending to the presid@@ ency, Frank@@ lin Del@@ ano Roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t sat down to lun@@ ch in the O@@ val Off@@ ice.
a g@@ our@@ m@@ and, President Roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t had a ta@@ ste for f@@ ancy Fi@@ f@@ th Avenue foo@@ ds like p@@ â@@ t@@ é de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mar@@ y@@ land ter@@ rap@@ in sou@@ p.

"@@ it was an act of cul@@ inary solid@@ arity with the people who were suffer@@ ing@@ ," Jan@@ e Z@@ i@@ eg@@ el@@ man said.
her hus@@ b@@ and, Andre@@ w Co@@ e, add@@ ed, "It was also a message to Americ@@ ans about how to e@@ at@@ ."
the cou@@ p@@ le, who live in Brook@@ ly@@ n H@@ eigh@@ ts, are food histor@@ i@@ ans.
Mr. Co@@ e's last book, "@@ Cho@@ p Su@@ ey@@ ," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while M@@ s. Z@@ i@@ eg@@ el@@ man told the story of life in a Low@@ er East S@@ ide te@@ ne@@ ment through food in her book "@@ 9@@ 7 Or@@ ch@@ ard@@ ."
their new@@ , collabor@@ ative work, "@@ A Square Me@@ al@@ ," which will be published Tu@@ es@@ day by Har@@ per@@ , is a history of American food in the Great Dep@@ res@@ sion.
showing some cul@@ inary solid@@ arity of their own@@ , they met a re@@ por@@ ter for din@@ ner at E@@ is@@ en@@ ber@@ g@@ 's Sand@@ w@@ ich Sho@@ p, a tin@@ y no@@ -@@ fr@@ ills lun@@ ch coun@@ ter in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron district that has been in business since the year of the cr@@ ash@@ , 19@@ 29@@ .
M@@ s. Z@@ i@@ eg@@ el@@ man, 5@@ 4, ordered a cream che@@ ese and ch@@ op@@ ped oli@@ ve s@@ and@@ w@@ ich, while Mr. Co@@ e, 5@@ 7, had the tur@@ ke@@ y, m@@ ash@@ ed pot@@ ato@@ es and veget@@ able med@@ le@@ y.
when a re@@ por@@ ter ordered me@@ at@@ lo@@ af@@ , the couple deemed it fit@@ ting for a discus@@ sion of Dep@@ res@@ sion@@ -@@ era e@@ ating.
"@@ lo@@ aves were very popul@@ ar@@ ," M@@ s. Z@@ i@@ eg@@ el@@ man said.
there was pe@@ an@@ ut lo@@ af@@ , liver lo@@ af@@ , be@@ an lo@@ af@@ .
they were made from an ingredi@@ ent and a cheap thing that stret@@ ches the ingredi@@ ent out.
imag@@ ine eating enough pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts to serve as your din@@ ner.
Mr. Co@@ e gri@@ mac@@ ed.
"@@ it must have sat in your stom@@ ach like lead@@ ," he said.
in the years before the Dep@@ res@@ sion, the American table, especially in r@@ ural areas, was an all-@@ you@@ -@@ can@@ -@@ eat buff@@ et.
teams of women coo@@ ked for male farm@@ work@@ ers, and f@@ resh@@ -@@ b@@ aked pi@@ e was served at breakfast@@ , lun@@ ch and din@@ ner.
it was Americ@@ ans who had sent food to star@@ ving Europe@@ ans during World War I. "@@ A Square Me@@ al@@ " chron@@ ic@@ les the ways the nation cop@@ ed with suddenly not being the land of pl@@ ent@@ y.
"@@ this was a time when food became a centr@@ al, fra@@ ught subject for the American people@@ ," Mr. Co@@ e said, expl@@ ain@@ ing why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
equ@@ ally fra@@ ught was the new budget di@@ et@@ : my@@ st@@ ery dish@@ es like lo@@ aves and c@@ ass@@ er@@ ol@@ es became st@@ ap@@ les, the c@@ ass@@ er@@ ole a "@@ wonderful way to re@@ purpose lef@@ to@@ vers@@ ," M@@ s.

str@@ ange m@@ ash@@ up@@ s were tried as cal@@ or@@ ic and nutri@@ tional ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ment took prec@@ ed@@ ent over ta@@ ste or even common kitchen sen@@ se.
in resear@@ ching the book, which includes reci@@ p@@ es, M@@ s. Z@@ i@@ eg@@ el@@ man prepared a period dis@@ h of b@@ aked on@@ ion stu@@ ff@@ ed with pe@@ an@@ ut but@@ ter.
"@@ it was not a popular addition to the din@@ ner table@@ ," Mr. Co@@ e said.
M@@ s. Z@@ i@@ eg@@ el@@ man am@@ pli@@ fi@@ ed: "@@ it was sur@@ real@@ ."
pe@@ an@@ ut but@@ ter has nothing to say to a b@@ aked on@@ ion.
it was character@@ istic of a lot of the hom@@ e-@@ e@@ c reci@@ p@@ es.

"@@ a Square Me@@ al@@ " is a fe@@ ast of historical ti@@ d@@ bit@@ s.

"@@ he li@@ ked to eat Contin@@ ental cuis@@ ine, like fish with c@@ uc@@ um@@ ber sa@@ uc@@ e@@ ," Mr. Co@@ e said.
he ate in almost a gol@@ d-@@ pl@@ ated dining room, wearing a din@@ ner jack@@ et.
he was fab@@ ul@@ ously out of tou@@ ch.
President Roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t may have committed the same error if his wif@@ e, Ele@@ an@@ or, had not encour@@ aged him to set an example with his stom@@ ach.
as the book tells it, Mr@@ s. Roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t's h@@ iring of a housekeep@@ er with no interest in flav@@ or resul@@ ted in a White House that "@@ put out not only some of the dre@@ ari@@ est food in Washington but also some of the most dis@@ m@@ ally prep@@ are@@ d@@ ."
many of the Dep@@ res@@ sion@@ -@@ era food ways were ab@@ and@@ oned as soon as the country got back on its fe@@ et.
the leg@@ acy is in our continued focus on cal@@ ories and nutri@@ tion, M@@ s. Z@@ i@@ eg@@ el@@ man said, and on the way science has been applied to c@@ ook@@ ing.
the couple said that in writing the book, they g@@ ained greater understanding of the eating hab@@ its of M@@ s. Z@@ i@@ eg@@ el@@ man@@ 's mother - how she couldn't th@@ row food away, for inst@@ ance.
"@@ she had a real fear of food was@@ te@@ ," Mr. Co@@ e said.
M@@ s. Z@@ i@@ eg@@ el@@ man rec@@ alle@@ d: "@@ she actually got people s@@ ick@@ ."
there was the cre@@ am@@ -@@ pu@@ ff incid@@ ent.
after the plates were cle@@ ared at E@@ is@@ en@@ ber@@ g@@ '@@ s, she and Mr. Co@@ e pulled out a d@@ ess@@ ert they had prepared at hom@@ e: the pr@@ une d@@ ess@@ ert that President Roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t ate for lun@@ ch.
"@@ it's called pr@@ une wh@@ ip@@ ," M@@ s. Z@@ i@@ eg@@ el@@ man said, adding that a common tr@@ ick was to give mod@@ est reci@@ pes a sn@@ azz@@ y name.
there was no wh@@ ip@@ ped cre@@ am, just pr@@ un@@ es, a little bit of fl@@ our, su@@ g@@ ar, water and cin@@ nam@@ on.
everyone rel@@ uc@@ t@@ antly di@@ pped a spo@@ on into the vis@@ c@@ ous brow@@ n goo@@ .
surpris@@ ingly, it wasn't b@@ ad.
Mr. Co@@ e went back for second@@ s, and thir@@ ds.
s@@ ounding like a can@@ -@@ do bud@@ get@@ er, he told his wif@@ e, "@@ Some ch@@ op@@ ped wal@@ n@@ u@@ ts would help@@ ."
un@@ fortun@@ ately, OP@@ EC@@ 's latest month@@ ly report shows that the cr@@ ude oil production in July continued to increase and Saudi Arab@@ i@@ a's output hit a new high@@ .
the report cannot prevent the market from dou@@ b@@ ting the cre@@ di@@ bility of OP@@ EC@@ . oil recovery path is still b@@ rist@@ led with thor@@ n@@ s.
on Mon@@ day, OP@@ E@@ C Chair@@ man and Q@@ at@@ ar Energy Minister S@@ ada said OP@@ E@@ C will hold an inform@@ al meeting during the International Energy Forum on September 26@@ -@@ 28@@ .
the month@@ ly report of OP@@ E@@ C on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day showed that the output of the entire OP@@ E@@ C organization in J@@ ul@@ y, including G@@ ab@@ on, increased by 46@@ ,000 bar@@ rel@@ s / day to 3@@ 3.@@ 11 million bar@@ rel@@ s / day.
OP@@ E@@ C also said in a month@@ ly report that low cr@@ ude oil prices have promp@@ ted global refin@@ ers to produce more refin@@ ed o@@ il, thus increasing the degree of exc@@ ess supply to the market.
affected by this new@@ s, coupl@@ ed with the production output expect@@ ations of rising cr@@ ude oil and the un@@ expected increase in cr@@ ude oil invent@@ ori@@ es, ag@@ grav@@ ating the exc@@ es@@ sive market suppl@@ y.
as of W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day@@ 's clo@@ se, the light cr@@ ude oil fut@@ ures of New York Mer@@ can@@ tile Exchange fell by 2.@@ 48@@ % in September and the future price of cr@@ ude oil in October in London B@@ rent fell by 2.@@ 07@@ %.
Re@@ u@@ ters believes that the proposed meeting of the o@@ il@@ -@@ produc@@ ing countries is unlikely to ti@@ gh@@ ten the suppl@@ y. the data released by US Energy Information Administration also sup@@ press the market s@@ enti@@ ment.
I@@ ran@@ 's official news agency F@@ ars on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day, quo@@ ting the spe@@ ech of Z@@ ang@@ ane@@ h, I@@ ran@@ ian oil minist@@ er, said that I@@ ran@@ 's daily cr@@ ude oil production was up to 3.@@ 8@@ 5 million bar@@ rel@@ s, which has been the highest level since 200@@ 8.
at the release of the news of the meet@@ ing, the Russian energy min@@ ister Nov@@ ak said that it was un@@ necessary to conduct a new round of fro@@ z@@ en production negoti@@ ations under the current oil price.
it was April when the o@@ il@@ -@@ produc@@ ing countries had meet@@ ing. no agreement was reached among the OP@@ E@@ C member countries.
Em@@ ma Ric@@ hard@@ s, an oil and gas analy@@ st at B@@ M@@ I@@ Res@@ ear@@ ch, said the market and the media could re@@ act exc@@ essi@@ vely to OP@@ EC@@ 's meet@@ ing.
Hel@@ im@@ a Cro@@ f@@ t, head of commod@@ ity strategy at Royal Bank of Canad@@ a, said OP@@ E@@ C changed the market s@@ enti@@ ment by rele@@ as@@ ing sign@@ als that they would make an agre@@ ement.
this means like a smo@@ ke and a mir@@ ror that draw@@ s people's attention (@@ deli@@ ber@@ ately giving a false impres@@ sion@@ ).
E@@ ug@@ en We@@ in@@ ber@@ g, director of commod@@ ity research at the German commercial ban@@ k, said the possibility of OP@@ E@@ C trying to st@@ abil@@ ize the market through the September meeting was low@@ .
this is likely to further under@@ mine the market confidence in OP@@ EC@@ . after all, this organization already st@@ aged a "@@ w@@ ol@@ f is com@@ ing@@ ."
all loc@@ alities should take medical institutions which have illegal medical advertis@@ ing, complain@@ ts foc@@ using on the past and have repe@@ ated@@ ly been pun@@ ished as a focus of inspec@@ tion.

according to media disclo@@ su@@ re, the large influ@@ x of capital into the Internet medic@@ ine has resul@@ ted in the serious problem of current product hom@@ ogen@@ e@@ ity. investment boo@@ m f@@ ade grad@@ ually and capital came into the wa@@ it@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ see perio@@ d.
according to the data of Hong Kong A@@ i Li P@@ i Hosp@@ ital Management Research Center, a large number of start@@ -up Internet medical companies langu@@ ished just within one year and about 20@@ % of the start@@ -up Internet medical companies has c@@ eas@@ ed to exist.
however, just as the majority of Internet medical companies stru@@ ggle in the road of A round or B round of fin@@ anc@@ ing, several sub-@@ areas leading enterprises can still get the capital tou@@ ted.
it seems that the Internet medical business shall not "@@ sw@@ arm@@ ," but to see the needs of the market, and be professional and prof@@ oun@@ d.
Yu@@ Y@@ ue inv@@ ested 12 million yu@@ an, accoun@@ ting for 40@@ % of the registered cap@@ it@@ al, while Ji@@ u@@ zh@@ out@@ ong inv@@ ested 18 million yu@@ an, accoun@@ ting for 60@@ % of the registered cap@@ it@@ al.
in recent years, with the country providing policy support in the medical information, electronic and integrated supply chain management system grad@@ ually enter the hospit@@ als at all level@@ s.
the cooperation between Yu@@ y@@ ue and Ji@@ u@@ zh@@ out@@ ong is aim@@ ed at the needs of the market, helping the hosp@@ ital to build advanced supply chain management system, and take this opportunity to seek more cooper@@ ation.
un@@ like many Internet medical companies which go in for gran@@ di@@ ose projec@@ ts, i@@ Bab@@ y foc@@ uses on the Internet ob@@ ste@@ tr@@ ics ver@@ tical field and be professional on pregn@@ ant mo@@ thers and doc@@ tor@@ s.
pregn@@ ant women can not only enjoy 24 hours of medical services free of charge and one-@@ on-@@ one in@@ quir@@ y with doc@@ tors, but also pay for medical coun@@ sel@@ ing.
at the doc@@ tor@@ 's side, i@@ Bab@@ y break@@ s the ge@@ ograph@@ ical restrictions by taking the form of organiz@@ ing experts to give gr@@ ass@@ ro@@ o@@ ts doc@@ tors an online lec@@ ture, pe@@ er ex@@ change, case discus@@ sion and so on.
at pres@@ ent, three plates are set up for doc@@ tor@@ 's client side, respec@@ tivel@@ y, for doc@@ tors to continue educ@@ ation, social exchange and communic@@ ation.
the following services are provid@@ ed, including online lear@@ ning, case discus@@ sion and academic ex@@ chang@@ e; social platform for the exchange of doc@@ tors of the same hosp@@ ital and depart@@ ment@@ ; legal assist@@ ance, business support and other services required by doc@@ tor@@ -@@ patient relationship or personal life.

the layout of Al@@ i in the medical and health field is divided into three pl@@ ates, nam@@ ely, Al@@ i Heal@@ th, L@@ yn@@ x Ph@@ arm@@ acy and Ali@@ pay future hospit@@ al.
W@@ ang Le@@ i ad@@ mitted that it was more difficult for medical and health companies to start up than other industri@@ es, "This is not just how much money you ha@@ ve. in addition, it requires people to be concentr@@ ated on it and end@@ ure the l@@ on@@ elin@@ ess.
staying up late watching the Olympic Games will damage the heart easily
Brazil Olympic Games is in full sw@@ ing. even if the event is broad@@ cast in the mid@@ night in China, many people will stay up late to wat@@ ch.
in this reg@@ ard, the doc@@ tor re@@ min@@ ded that staying up late has health risks and may lead to car@@ di@@ ov@@ asc@@ ular diseas@@ e.
if you stay up for a long time, the hor@@ m@@ one will have a lot of secre@@ tion and your body will continue to be in a state of inten@@ se exci@@ te@@ ment and cannot have normal recover@@ y. this may easily cause v@@ as@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tion, blood pressure and thus car@@ di@@ ov@@ asc@@ ular diseas@@ e.
H@@ an Z@@ hi@@ yuan re@@ min@@ ded people who have high blood pressu@@ re, high blood su@@ g@@ ar, high blood lip@@ id@@ s, smoking hab@@ its, family history and other car@@ di@@ ov@@ asc@@ ular risk factors may easily suff@@ er from car@@ di@@ ov@@ asc@@ ular disease if staying up l@@ ate.
if you stay up l@@ ate, then your car@@ di@@ ov@@ asc@@ ular function will be aff@@ ec@@ ted, your g@@ ast@@ ro@@ in@@ test@@ inal func@@ tion, imm@@ une system, ne@@ uro@@ en@@ do@@ cr@@ ine system will also be aff@@ ec@@ ted, and even the risk of cancer will increas@@ e.
for old friend@@ s, H@@ an Z@@ hi@@ yuan sugg@@ ested them better not stay up late to watch gam@@ es, particularly those with car@@ di@@ ov@@ asc@@ ular diseas@@ e.
during the last "@@ World C@@ up@@ " football mat@@ ch, H@@ an Z@@ hi@@ yuan received a 60@@ -@@ year-@@ old pati@@ ent. his on@@ set of my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ c@@ tion may be related with staying up late to watch gam@@ es.
according to H@@ an Z@@ hi@@ yu@@ an, his department had treated some 25@@ -@@ year-@@ old my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ c@@ tion or stro@@ ke pati@@ ents. this is larg@@ ely due to long-term stay up of pati@@ ents.
1. do not stay up late every day. you can occasion@@ ally stay up all night watching the favorite sports and watch the re@@ broad@@ cast for other sports next day.
2. you may drink more water, have more fruit during stay up as this can prevent blood c@@ logg@@ ing and enhance your body imm@@ un@@ ity.

the film is expected to first show on CC@@ TV and Let@@ v in the early next year. a V@@ R pan@@ or@@ amic docu@@ mentary version will also be launched for the first time.
the docu@@ mentary "@@ Pol@@ ar@@ " is a larg@@ e-@@ scale work that foc@@ uses on the world's third po@@ le, Qing@@ ha@@ i-@@ Ti@@ bet Pl@@ ate@@ au@@ . it tells a story for the integration of Ti@@ bet@@ an tradition and the modern world and the inter@@ action between Ti@@ bet and the world from a new perspec@@ tive.
the biggest advantage for V@@ R works is to enable the audi@@ ence to have a unique movie watching "@@ im@@ mer@@ sion@@ " and this also raise a higher request for the sho@@ o@@ ting process.
the production team of "@@ Pol@@ ar@@ " Pan@@ or@@ ama V@@ R special e@@ dition said that they will ensure that every aspect of the screen is imp@@ ec@@ cable and let the audi@@ ences have sens@@ es of im@@ mer@@ si@@ ve.
on August 11, the Ar@@ med Pol@@ ice Sh@@ and@@ ong Cor@@ ps Y@@ an@@ tai det@@ ach@@ ment organized special war s@@ ni@@ per@@ s to have j@@ ung@@ le training at K@@ un@@ y@@ u Mountain under the high temperature of 34 degre@@ es Cel@@ si@@ us.
during the C@@ old W@@ ar, the Soviet Union trans@@ ported the mis@@ s@@ ile into C@@ ub@@ a, which almost led to the US@@ -@@ Soviet nuclear war@@ .
this event was seen as the pin@@ n@@ acle of the cold war@@ , known as the "@@ C@@ ub@@ an mis@@ s@@ ile cris@@ is@@ ."
but what is little known is that during the C@@ old W@@ ar, a strong solar stor@@ m has almost led to a nuclear war of the United States against the Soviet Uni@@ on. the incid@@ ent has not been announced by the research@@ ers until August 9.
on May 23, 196@@ 7, a strong solar stor@@ m caused strong inter@@ ference to the rad@@ ar and radio communications of the US military in the Ar@@ c@@ tic@@ .
these rad@@ ars were part of the ball@@ istic mis@@ s@@ ile early war@@ ning system of the US@@ , used for monitoring Soviet mis@@ sil@@ es.
this paper was written by research@@ ers at the University of Color@@ ad@@ o, who inter@@ viewed US military personnel involved in the forec@@ asting and analysis of solar activity and re@@ viewed non-@@ confidenti@@ al docu@@ ments.
the paper wrote that in the 19@@ 60@@ s, in order to prevent the Soviet Union from suddenly laun@@ ching nuclear war@@ , the US Air Force has always had some fi@@ gh@@ ters with nuclear war@@ head@@ s fl@@ ying in the sk@@ y.
us military command@@ ers did not know that the cul@@ pri@@ t of the inter@@ ference was the solar stor@@ m rather than the Soviet Uni@@ on, so they ordered the fi@@ gh@@ ters to enter comb@@ at read@@ in@@ ess state@@ .
fortun@@ ately, the US military force had started the study of solar activities and its electro@@ magnetic inter@@ ference to the Earth since the 19@@ 50@@ s, it ul@@ ti@@ mately stopped this potential military conflic@@ t.
later, he sum@@ mar@@ ized the information provided by the US Air Force Air Mete@@ or@@ ological Service and submitted a detailed re@@ port.
the direct consequ@@ ence of this solar stor@@ m is that the US military has seen space weather as a comb@@ at concern and has built a strong@@ er space weather forec@@ ast system.

from August 11, Xi@@ '@@ an traffic police We@@ Chat service number "@@ Xi@@ '@@ an traffic polic@@ e" launched "@@ We@@ Chat vehicle mo@@ v@@ ing@@ " service.
after the laun@@ ching of this service, during daily life, when the citizens found their cars were ham@@ per@@ ed by un@@ familiar vehic@@ les, the driver of which is not at the scen@@ e, they may solve the problems via "@@ We@@ Ch@@ at@@ " func@@ tion.
the new service has many func@@ tions, the first of which is fast effici@@ ency, saving administrative cost@@ s; the second is respec@@ ting and protecting the privacy of citiz@@ ens@@ ; and the third is all-@@ weather and full-@@ time service.
citizens can operate it quite conveni@@ ently with their We@@ Ch@@ at. such method enables the both sides to meet in a friendly and easy way and alle@@ vi@@ ates and sol@@ ves the problem of difficul@@ ty of parking and reduces the oc@@ curren@@ ce rate of car@@ -@@ related public security cas@@ es.
on the other hand, for those who refuse to move and have illegal parking or ob@@ struc@@ tion, Xi@@ '@@ an traffic control department said the traffic police will take different measures to handle the actual situation based on the actual situ@@ ation.

on April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly issued a new version of "@@ US@@ -@@ Japan defense cooperation guidelin@@ es" in New York, allowing the Japanese armed forces to play a more off@@ ensive role in the world.
this is the day the US Def@@ ense Secretary Car@@ ter, US Secretary of State K@@ err@@ y, Japanese Foreign Minister F@@ um@@ io K@@ ish@@ ida and Japan@@ 's Minister of Def@@ ense G@@ en N@@ ak@@ at@@ ani attended the press conference in New Yor@@ k.
this is the fif@@ th time that China's ci@@ v@@ ilian think tank has published the Japanese military assess@@ ment report and the fourth launch of the English ver@@ sion.
the report is divided into n@@ ine ch@@ ap@@ ters, including the overall policy adjust@@ ment, military streng@@ th, defense bud@@ get@@ , military dep@@ loy@@ ment, weap@@ ons and equipment, military system re@@ form, military train@@ ing, foreign military security cooperation and military security relations with China and so on.
the report said that the year 2015 is a ph@@ ased last year of the A@@ be government to promote major policy adjust@@ ments in the security area.
since then, Japan@@ 's initi@@ atives in the field of security will be mainly in the legal system, strategy imple@@ ment@@ ation, policy implementation and other operational level, rather than the substanti@@ al adjust@@ ments and changes of fr@@ ame@@ work, mechan@@ isms and polici@@ es.
the report emphas@@ ized that the A@@ be Cab@@ inet tried to break through the above three points to achieve the promotion of Japan@@ 's "@@ normal nation@@ aliz@@ ation@@ ," and the go@@ ing-@@ out of mil@@ iti@@ a to inter@@ ven@@ e in international security aff@@ air@@ s, strengthen Japan@@ -@@ US alli@@ ance and prevent the rise of China and res@@ ist China.
previ@@ ously, the China Strateg@@ y and Culture Pro@@ motion Council released the Japanese military assess@@ ment report on June 5, 201@@ 2, July 19, 201@@ 3, July 23, 2014 and June 30, 201@@ 5.

improvement of public sports facilities
dark co@@ al field ware@@ house is turned into a "@@ green gr@@ ass@@ " football field while red br@@ ick sp@@ ire plant is turned into a modern sports muse@@ um.
on the national fitness day, N@@ an@@ lu@@ o May@@ ing Sports Culture Park, outside the Hangzhou W@@ ang@@ jiang g@@ ate, un@@ ve@@ iled its my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous ve@@ il.
it was a co@@ al field once and remained id@@ le for more than 10 years after its clo@@ su@@ re. a large number of illegal construction and g@@ arb@@ age were left beh@@ ind@@ .
after the renov@@ ation, it became a sports and cultural par@@ k, and will be offici@@ ally opened in November to the public free of charge to provide sports venu@@ es. in addition, it would und@@ ou@@ b@@ ted@@ ly open up a new fer@@ tile soil for the whole people.
this re@@ min@@ ds people of Hangzhou Ch@@ en Jing@@ l@@ un Scho@@ ol. this is a "@@ Wh@@ am@@ po@@ a Mil@@ itary Academ@@ y" in China's swimming world, in which several world champ@@ ions were bor@@ n.
swimming champ@@ ions will be produced continu@@ ously, produc@@ ing a vi@@ vi@@ d inter@@ pret@@ ation of the relationship between competitive sports and national sport@@ s. the pro@@ found mass base provided a good condition for selecting professional play@@ ers.
the level of competitive sports is closely related to the foundation of national sport@@ s. ath@@ le@@ tic sports dep@@ end in a certain sense on national sport@@ s, and national sports dep@@ end on the conditions of the site.
according to report@@ s, as of 2015, the area of China's per cap@@ ita sports venu@@ es has been 150 times of that when the new China was establish@@ ed, but still far behind the sports pow@@ er.
in June this year, the State Council issued a "@@ National Fit@@ ness Program (@@ 2016 - 20@@ 20@@ )@@ " and took the development of mass sports as a key content.
in order to fill the short board, on the one hand, the relevant depart@@ ments shall take full account of the layout of the st@@ adi@@ um at urban plann@@ ing.
on the other hand, the already built public sports venu@@ es, including schools and other units in the sports venu@@ es, should try to expand the scope of open@@ ness and try to improve efficiency as much as possible.

Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ton on Fri@@ day released her 2015 tax retur@@ n@@ s, which showed the Democratic presid@@ ential nom@@ ine@@ e and her husband had $@@ 10.@@ 75 million in income that year and paid an effective fed@@ eral tax rate of 3@@ 4.@@ 2 percent@@ .
in 2015, the Clin@@ tons made $@@ 1 million in char@@ itable contribu@@ tions, mostly to the Clin@@ ton Found@@ ation; former President B@@ ill Clin@@ ton brought in nearly $@@ 5.@@ 3 million in speaking fe@@ es; and the former sec@@ ret@@ ary of state reported income of $@@ 3 million from pub@@ lis@@ her Sim@@ on & Sch@@ us@@ ter for her book on her ten@@ ure at the State Depart@@ ment.
Clin@@ ton@@ 's running ma@@ te, U.S. Sen@@ ator Ti@@ m K@@ a@@ ine of Vir@@ gin@@ ia, along with his wif@@ e, An@@ ne Hol@@ ton, released 10 years of tax retur@@ n@@ s.
they paid a fed@@ eral effective tax rate of 20@@ .@@ 3 percent in 201@@ 5.
"@@ Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ton and Ti@@ m K@@ a@@ ine continue to set the standard for financial transparen@@ cy@@ ," Clin@@ ton campa@@ ign a@@ ide J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ er@@ i said in a state@@ ment.
in star@@ k contr@@ ast, Don@@ ald Tr@@ ump is hid@@ ing behind fa@@ ke exc@@ uses and back@@ tracking on his previous promis@@ es to release his tax retur@@ n@@ s.
it is custom@@ ary for U.S. presid@@ ential can@@ di@@ dates to make their tax retur@@ ns public@@ , although they are not required by law to do so.
Tr@@ um@@ p, a New York business@@ man, and his law@@ yers have ci@@ ted an au@@ dit by the Inter@@ nal Re@@ venue Service as a reason for his ref@@ us@@ al to release his retur@@ n@@ s.
"@@ your move@@ ," Clin@@ ton campa@@ ign a@@ ide I@@ an Sam@@ s said on Tw@@ it@@ ter, lin@@ king to the Democratic nom@@ ine@@ e's retur@@ n@@ s.
on Th@@ urs@@ day, Tr@@ ump@@ 's special coun@@ sel@@ , Michael Co@@ h@@ en, told CN@@ N he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release them until the aud@@ its are comple@@ te.
Tr@@ ump@@ 's cri@@ tics, including 2012 Republic@@ an presid@@ ential can@@ di@@ date M@@ it@@ t Rom@@ ney and other fel@@ low Republic@@ ans, have said his ref@@ us@@ al ra@@ ises questions about his net wor@@ th, his char@@ itable contribu@@ tions, his business deal@@ ings and various other ties, including with Russi@@ a.
Clin@@ ton has p@@ ounc@@ ed on the issu@@ e, rele@@ as@@ ing an online video on Fri@@ day high@@ lighting high-@@ profile Republic@@ ans urg@@ ing Tr@@ ump to release his tax@@ es.
on Th@@ urs@@ day, she raised the issue during an economic spe@@ ech in Mic@@ h@@ ig@@ an.
"@@ he ref@@ uses to do what every other presid@@ ential can@@ di@@ date in dec@@ ades has done and release his tax retur@@ n@@ s," she told the crow@@ d.
poli@@ tic@@ o has reported that Tr@@ ump paid zer@@ o to very little tax@@ es for two years in the 199@@ 0@@ s, and a New York Times business colum@@ n@@ ist on Fri@@ day quo@@ ted a number of tax law@@ yers and accoun@@ t@@ ants saying that could still be the case.
Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presid@@ ential elec@@ tion.
Clin@@ ton has endor@@ sed a rule named after billi@@ on@@ aire invest@@ or War@@ ren Bu@@ ff@@ et@@ t that would ensure those making more than $@@ 1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent@@ .

Clin@@ ton@@ 's campa@@ ign has released tax retur@@ ns going back to 200@@ 7.

Jewish fil@@ m@@ maker sl@@ ams Berlin hotel for remo@@ ving Israel di@@ al code after Arab "@@ reques@@ t@@ " - R@@ T News
a French fil@@ m@@ maker of Jewish orig@@ in un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed a media fu@@ ror after he reve@@ aled that the K@@ emp@@ in@@ ski B@@ rist@@ ol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel@@ 's di@@ al co@@ de, with employee c@@ iting "@@ reques@@ ts@@ " from Arab@@ ic customers.
Cla@@ ude Lan@@ z@@ man@@ n, an author of Ho@@ loc@@ a@@ ust docu@@ mentary "@@ Sho@@ ah@@ ," ven@@ ted his fr@@ ustr@@ ation at the K@@ emp@@ in@@ ski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin@@ , writing an open letter in the German out@@ let FA@@ Z@@ .
during his recent st@@ ay, Lan@@ z@@ man@@ n tried to find Israel in the list of di@@ al codes provided by the hotel.
the country howe@@ ver was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room.
how is it possib@@ le, in 2016 in Berlin@@ , the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was elimin@@ ated and er@@ ad@@ ic@@ ated@@ ?
Lan@@ z@@ man@@ n wro@@ te.
in@@ ste@@ ad, K@@ emp@@ in@@ ski B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to di@@ al Israel via an own call center@@ .
seeking explan@@ ation, the fil@@ m@@ maker addres@@ sed the issue at the hotel's recep@@ tion.
the answer he got there, Lan@@ z@@ man@@ n wrote "@@ shoc@@ ked him@@ ."
the hotel's cl@@ er@@ k said that the measure was "@@ a deli@@ ber@@ ate decision by the management of K@@ emp@@ ins@@ ki@@ -@@ Hotel@@ s."
the reason behind the move trigg@@ ered even more ou@@ tr@@ age by the fil@@ m@@ mak@@ er.
"the majority of our guests are Arab@@ s and they dem@@ anded Israel@@ 's code to be dele@@ ted@@ ," the employee was quo@@ ted as saying by Lan@@ z@@ man@@ n.
Israel@@ i am@@ bass@@ ador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ o@@ v H@@ ad@@ as@@ -@@ Hand@@ el@@ s@@ man called the case a "@@ great sh@@ ame@@ ," Sud@@ de@@ ut@@ sche Z@@ e@@ it@@ ung report@@ s.
we were app@@ all@@ ed and shoc@@ ked by the incid@@ ent.
it is in itself a great sh@@ am@@ e.
the fact that it has occur@@ red in Germany and at that very hotel ch@@ ain, is an even greater dis@@ gr@@ ace.
that needs no explan@@ ation.
we expect that the hotel draw@@ s the right concl@@ us@@ ion@@ s, "the official said.
the incid@@ ent trigg@@ ered quite a response on@@ line, with people calling it a sc@@ and@@ al.
some alleg@@ ed that the K@@ emp@@ in@@ ski hotel simply "@@ c@@ av@@ ed in@@ " to the alleg@@ ed demands of Arab@@ ic customers.
"@@ sh@@ ame on you@@ ," another post state@@ d, poin@@ ting out that the hotel, located in the no@@ ble K@@ ur@@ fur@@ s@@ ten@@ dam@@ m street stands near a syn@@ ago@@ gu@@ e.
the hotel itself was quick to br@@ ush off any acc@@ us@@ ations, calling what happened an "@@ over@@ sight@@ " and "@@ apo@@ logi@@ z@@ ing@@ " to Lan@@ z@@ man@@ n, D@@ er Sp@@ i@@ eg@@ el report@@ s.
"@@ there was never a direct ord@@ er@@ " not to include Israel in the fast di@@ al li@@ st, "@@ Sud@@ de@@ ut@@ sche Z@@ e@@ it@@ ung quo@@ ted a K@@ emp@@ in@@ ski representative as say@@ ing.

police used te@@ ar gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the pro@@ test@@ ers.
the trou@@ ble started when law enforc@@ ement offic@@ ers tried to dis@@ per@@ se the stud@@ ents, which led to the police using rubber bul@@ lets and te@@ ar g@@ as.
several hundred students took part in the demon@@ stration to express their dis@@ may at the plan@@ s.
under propos@@ als from the govern@@ or of the state of S@@ ao Paul@@ o Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min@@ , just under 100 public schools will be clos@@ ed, while 300@@ ,000 students will be re@@ located in order to save money.

S@@ co@@ t C@@ all@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms home as Br@@ its gr@@ ab cycl@@ ing gold
Scot@@ land@@ 's C@@ all@@ um Sk@@ inner rac@@ ed to glory in the men@@ 's team spr@@ int at the Rio vel@@ o@@ dro@@ me last night as the Team GB tri@@ o def@@ ended the title from London 201@@ 2.
the G@@ las@@ we@@ gi@@ an 23@@ -@@ year-@@ old was in the anch@@ or role that his fel@@ low S@@ co@@ ts@@ man S@@ ir Chr@@ is Ho@@ y made his own and the youn@@ g@@ ster did the leg@@ end proud as he stor@@ med home to sn@@ at@@ ch vic@@ tory from the fav@@ oured New Zealand out@@ f@@ it.
Brit@@ ain claim@@ ed a sho@@ ck vic@@ tory four years ago to win as Ho@@ y claim@@ ed the fif@@ th of his six Olympic gol@@ ds.
and they repe@@ ated the tr@@ ick after fin@@ ishing a low@@ ly six@@ th at Mar@@ ch@@ 's Tr@@ ack World Champ@@ ion@@ ships in London, despite Ho@@ y having since re@@ ti@@ red.
the issue between Beijing and London was replac@@ ing specialist star@@ ter Jam@@ ie Sta@@ ff@@ .
they did so just in time as H@@ ind@@ es emerg@@ ed.
Ho@@ y's re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment also created a void which K@@ ian Em@@ ad@@ i and Mat@@ t Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to f@@ ill@@ .
Sk@@ inner was the man Brit@@ ain@@ 's co@@ aches st@@ uck with, seeing potential in the S@@ co@@ t which has now been real@@ is@@ ed.
H@@ ind@@ es, K@@ enn@@ y - champ@@ ions with Ho@@ y four years ago - and Sk@@ inner set an Olympic record in quali@@ f@@ y@@ ing, but the standard was over@@ taken by New Zealand in the first r@@ oun@@ d.
and the British tri@@ o won the du@@ el for gol@@ d.
H@@ ind@@ es was nar@@ row@@ ly behind after his lap@@ , but K@@ enn@@ y pushed the team in front and Sk@@ inner held on.
a change of strategy was a big part of the transform@@ ation, with H@@ ind@@ es ri@@ ding a big@@ ger gear to s@@ low him down and allow K@@ enn@@ y and, in particul@@ ar, Sk@@ inner to keep p@@ ace.
Ho@@ y watched on from his position as a B@@ BC pun@@ dit and caught the eye of Sk@@ in@@ ner, K@@ enn@@ y and H@@ ind@@ es when they ste@@ pped on to the po@@ di@@ um.
the 23@@ -@@ year-@@ old Sk@@ in@@ ner, from G@@ las@@ g@@ ow, said: "@@ it's a fl@@ atter@@ ing compar@@ is@@ on@@ ."
I'm just out there to do my best and make a name for my@@ self.
we set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champ@@ ion@@ s.
it was just incredi@@ ble.
there's no better way to win it.
after tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ing at London 2012 al@@ ong@@ side K@@ enn@@ y and Ho@@ y, H@@ ind@@ es ad@@ mitted to deli@@ ber@@ ately fall@@ ing to the track following a poor star@@ t.
he later re@@ trac@@ ted the comment and there was no method of appe@@ al from Brit@@ ain@@ 's riv@@ als.
there was no such issue this time around in a su@@ pre@@ me vic@@ tor@@ y.
H@@ ind@@ es said: "@@ it felt like London, with all the GB fl@@ ags in the stand@@ ."
we all as a team came together in the last three month@@ s.
we@@ 've been lo@@ sing out on so many world tit@@ les, so to win the Olymp@@ ics again is just amaz@@ ing.
that is one ev@@ ent, one gold med@@ al for the nation which won seven out of 10 track tit@@ les in both Beijing and London@@ .
if that is a bar@@ ome@@ ter of the progress made in the last five months, then a successful five days in the vel@@ o@@ dro@@ me aw@@ a@@ its.
with the form K@@ enn@@ y demonstr@@ ated, it is not beyond the real@@ ms of possibility to imag@@ ine him repe@@ ating Ho@@ y's fe@@ at of winning three Olympic gol@@ ds in one Gam@@ es.
that would see K@@ enn@@ y - who is exactly 12 years youn@@ ger than Ho@@ y, who is also born on 23 March (@@ that seem@@ ingly sac@@ red date in British s@@ port which is also the birth@@ day of Ste@@ ve Red@@ gr@@ ave, M@@ o Far@@ ah and Ro@@ ger Ban@@ ni@@ ster@@ ) - take his tally to six gold med@@ als and one sil@@ ver.
that would be the same as Ho@@ y@@ '@@ s.
K@@ enn@@ y next compe@@ tes in the spr@@ in@@ t, which begins on today and plays out over three days.
the 28@@ -@@ year-@@ old from Bol@@ ton said: "I'm just enjo@@ ying this one for now.
the team event is always the b@@ est.
you get to win it with your ma@@ tes.
it's a bit l@@ on@@ ely winning on your own to be hon@@ est.
H@@ ind@@ es said: "@@ if he win@@ s another two gold med@@ als, he should get a k@@ nigh@@ th@@ oo@@ d@@ ."
it was the day@@ 's only med@@ al ev@@ ent, but there was further good news for Brit@@ ain@@ .
si@@ r Br@@ ad@@ ley W@@ ig@@ gin@@ s, E@@ d Cl@@ anc@@ y, Ste@@ ven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified fas@@ test in the four@@ -@@ man, four@@ -@@ kilomet@@ res team pursu@@ it.
they finished in 3: 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 4@@ 3.
the world record@@ , set in winning gold at London 201@@ 2, is 3: 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59@@ .
the first round and final (@@ 10.@@ 4@@ 2@@ p@@ m) take place on today's second day of action, where W@@ ig@@ g@@ ins is sure to be the foc@@ us.
he had a dispute with comm@@ is@@ s@@ aires y@@ ester@@ day ahead of the quali@@ fication rid@@ e, when offici@@ als sum@@ mon@@ ed him to measure his he@@ igh@@ t.

team GB have come to rely on its migh@@ ty track cycl@@ ing squ@@ ad to take own@@ ership of the middle period of an Olympic Games and deliver a host of med@@ als.
after truly exceptional show@@ ings of ut@@ ter domin@@ ance at Beijing and London, expect@@ ations have been played down in the lead@@ -up to Ri@@ o.
there have been dram@@ as in the back@@ ground, not least the re@@ sign@@ ation of technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April am@@ id sex@@ ism and bul@@ lying alleg@@ ations, and the re@@ ti@@ re@@ ments of gi@@ ant fig@@ ures like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on.
however, on the evidence of the first night@@ 's r@@ acing in the vel@@ o@@ dro@@ me, it looks like GB@@ 's now leg@@ end@@ ary reputation for pe@@ aking at the perfect time could be about to be repe@@ ated once again.
after the little baby came to this world, Mom and D@@ ad shall be responsible for his life, not only for his heal@@ th, but also for the development of his spir@@ it, that is, educ@@ ation.
if such education fail@@ ed, then no matter how successful your career is, you cannot make up for the short@@ com@@ ings of life and family fail@@ ure.
when a new baby is bor@@ n, the new d@@ ad and mo@@ m need to spend time in taking care of and educ@@ ating him, and be responsible for him.
and responsibility is not only refl@@ ected in the care of body, making them health@@ y, but also the education of spir@@ it. that is, to make children learn how to be@@ ha@@ ve, grow up and succ@@ e@@ ed.
good family education means that parents often need to ac@@ company their children, to take care of them pati@@ ently and teach them develop a civil@@ ized behavior and make them learn knowledge better and enhance intellig@@ ence.
paren@@ t@@ s' words and de@@ eds will affect the growth of their children because they will im@@ it@@ ate their paren@@ ts. and that is the so cal@@ led, "@@ like fa@@ ther, like son@@ ." your son will be the same as you.
so we need to be a good example in front of children, regul@@ ate our words, cultiv@@ ate our character@@ s, which will in@@ directly help children shape their own excellent charac@@ ter, so that he will become more excell@@ ent.

the head of the Department of Industrial Co@@ ord@@ ination of the National Development and Re@@ form Commission said that iron and steel over@@ capacity is now a global problem.
China's capacity utiliz@@ ation in recent years is higher than the global a@@ ver@@ age, but also higher than that of the United States and Europe and other countries and region@@ s.
China has taken resol@@ ute and effective measures to resol@@ ve exc@@ ess capac@@ ity, and the results are grad@@ ually emerg@@ ing.
the official poin@@ ted out that the C@@ PC Central Committee and State Council should att@@ ach great importance to the global problem of iron and steel over@@ capac@@ ity.
all depart@@ ments and regions should actively implement the dep@@ loyment of the State Counc@@ il, ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly carry out the work, and reduce cr@@ ude steel production capacity by 45 million tons this year.
from China's national conditions, China does not encourage steel ex@@ port@@ s. on the contr@@ ary, it also takes a series of practical measures to control steel ex@@ port@@ s.
the person in charge stres@@ sed that the international trade of iron and steel products is ess@@ enti@@ ally a market behavior and an independent choice from the require@@ ment of import@@ ing countries and after considering the product cost and other factor@@ s.
the implementation of trade protection measures does not help to fundam@@ ent@@ ally solve the global steel industry development issu@@ es. on the contr@@ ary, it will only cause further impact on the international trade ord@@ er.
when it comes to deb@@ t, the person in charge stres@@ sed that the resolution of the de@@ bt problem is to properly handle the important issues that need proper hand@@ l@@ ing.
as the iron and steel enterprises are larg@@ e-@@ scale and invol@@ ve a wide range of enterpris@@ es, the de@@ bt relationship is complex@@ . it may lead to regional risks if dis@@ posed of im@@ proper@@ ly.
according to the person in charg@@ e, in recent years, with the economic down@@ ward pressure to increas@@ e, the total social demand grad@@ ually weak@@ en@@ ed, part of the industry capacity utiliz@@ ation dec@@ reas@@ ed and enterprise production and management difficul@@ ties increas@@ ed.
some enterprises do not meet the changes in the market environment and the production and management is difficult to su@@ st@@ ain or even on the br@@ ink of coll@@ ap@@ se. but re@@ str@@ ained by some institu@@ tional fac@@ tors, they become "@@ z@@ ombi@@ e enterpris@@ es" due to many ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les to the market.
the existence of these companies di@@ stor@@ ted market sign@@ al, reduced the elements resources use effici@@ ency, increased the cost of social management, there@@ by h@@ ind@@ ering the establishment of market environment with fair competi@@ tion.
the main reason for the loss is the same as the dil@@ em@@ ma fac@@ ed by the global steel industry - we@@ ak market demand and low utiliz@@ ation r@@ ate.
China mainly adop@@ ts the market mechan@@ ism, economic means and the rule of law. the government is mainly to do the work of disclo@@ sing the ins and ou@@ ts to workers and social st@@ ability, to ensure fair and equ@@ itable market ord@@ er.
the person in charge stres@@ sed that the next step is to do a good job to ensure over@@ capacity cutting and ensuring the objec@@ tive of resol@@ ving 100 million ton@@ s-@@ 150 million tons of cr@@ ude steel production capacity within five years.
in the afterno@@ on of the 10@@ th day of the month, the appearance of Chinese tourist police in the Red Square in Moscow immediately dre@@ w people's atten@@ tion. Chinese tou@@ rists wav@@ ed with surpris@@ e, and the local people and foreign tou@@ rists cannot help but to stop looking back.
on the same day, China's first professional travel police team - members of Tourism Pol@@ ice Det@@ ach@@ ment, S@@ any@@ a City, H@@ ain@@ an Province Public Security B@@ ure@@ au came to the Red Square in Mo@@ sc@@ ow, and communic@@ ated with the local police on d@@ ut@@ y.
Moscow travel police are divided into three groups for duty pat@@ ro@@ l in the Red Squ@@ are, Nic@@ oli@@ es@@ ki ped@@ est@@ ri@@ an street and G@@ u M@@ u Department Sto@@ re. the Chinese tourist police also followed for stud@@ y. the whole process las@@ ted more than an hour@@ .
female police offic@@ er Li@@ u Xin@@ ie is 20@@ -@@ plus years old, pro@@ fici@@ ent in English and Span@@ ish@@ . she just joined the tour@@ ism police team last year.
he carefully ob@@ served every word and action of the Russian counter@@ parts and communic@@ ated with her from time to time.
when he saw Spanish tou@@ rists come for consult@@ ation, the Moscow travel police expl@@ ained to him with flu@@ ent Span@@ ish, which impres@@ sed W@@ ang B@@ ing.
"@@ every Moscow travel polic@@ em@@ an master foreign langu@@ age, and some even can speak more than two langu@@ ages, which impres@@ sed us a lot@@ ."
"@@ H@@ ain@@ an, as an international tourist is@@ land, is grad@@ ually paying attention to at@@ tract international tou@@ rist@@ s. we hope to improve their ability to match the status of international tour@@ ism is@@ land@@ ."
on the current day before the stud@@ y, the Chinese tourist police also went to the bri@@ g@@ ade station of Moscow city police to communicate with their Russian counter@@ part@@ s.
"I often deal with Chinese tou@@ rists and I am very happen to see them travel to Russi@@ a@@ ."
"@@ their usual questions are: where is xx@@ x, for example, where is a monu@@ ment, how to rent a taxi and how to return to the hotel@@ ."
Le@@ i S@@ ak@@ ov@@ , the bri@@ g@@ ade cap@@ tain of Moscow city police said that in recent years, Mo@@ sc@@ ow@@ 's urban environment and tour@@ ism ambi@@ ence have become better and bet@@ ter, attrac@@ ting more and more foreign tou@@ rist@@ s.
in order to meet the needs of tour@@ ism development, it set up a tourist police team in July 2014, responsible for pat@@ ro@@ l in the major scen@@ ic spo@@ ts, thus helping and di@@ ver@@ ting the tou@@ rist@@ s.
at pres@@ ent, all Moscow tourist polic@@ em@@ en are pro@@ fici@@ ent in English and some also master Spanish and German@@ .
the police bri@@ g@@ ade divided them into n@@ ine groups according to their foreign language level@@ s. they have two classes per wee@@ k, learn self-@@ defense mo@@ ves, laws and regulations and foreign langu@@ ages.
"@@ at pres@@ ent, there are two tourist police beginning to learn Chinese and they can speak flu@@ ent@@ ly. we have to continue to improve their Chinese level@@ ," L@@ ys@@ ak@@ o@@ v said.
L@@ ys@@ ak@@ o@@ v told re@@ por@@ ters that the Moscow Tourism Pol@@ ice since its inc@@ ep@@ tion, have acc@@ um@@ ulated a certain amount of experience and ho@@ ped to insp@@ ire counter@@ parts in S@@ any@@ a.
he believes that the cooperation between the Russian and Chinese police depart@@ ments will enhance the security sense of their citizens to each other@@ 's national tour@@ ism.
"the recru@@ it@@ ing, police mode and equipment of Moscow tour police offic@@ ers and their excellent inter@@ actions with visitors have brought us a lot of in@@ spir@@ ation@@ ." Ch@@ en Xi@@ a@@ ok@@ un said.
Chin@@ an@@ ew@@ s journ@@ alist found that there are at least n@@ ine provinc@@ es and cities issu@@ ing rules for the implementation of resid@@ ence per@@ mit@@ , including He@@ be@@ i, J@@ il@@ in, Ti@@ anj@@ in, Jiang@@ xi@@ , Sic@@ hu@@ an, H@@ ain@@ an, G@@ an@@ su@@ , Fu@@ j@@ ian and Beijing, etc.
for the conditions of applying for resid@@ ence per@@ mit@@ , the above regions generally said that the applic@@ ants need to live more than six months and meet one of these three require@@ ments: having legitimate and stable employ@@ ment, having legal and stable resid@@ ence and continuous stud@@ y.
Chin@@ an@@ ew@@ s journ@@ alist noted that in the aspect of resid@@ ence per@@ mit providing treat@@ ment, the "@@ gold content@@ " is different in various ci@@ ties. compared with the national provision@@ s, some areas have provided more public services and conveni@@ ences.
these areas have increased the conveni@@ ences of children to atten@@ d college entrance examination in the local place while meeting the related require@@ ment.
in addition, it is clearly proposed by Beijing and other places that they will grad@@ ually expand the scope of public services and conveni@@ ence, and regul@@ arly release to the commun@@ ity.
for example, Fu@@ j@@ ian proposed to ann@@ oun@@ ce the public services and convenience of resid@@ ence per@@ mit holders to the public at least every 3 years
"@@ resid@@ ence Per@@ mit Pro@@ vision@@ al Regul@@ ation@@ s" provides that, for those in line with the resid@@ ence per@@ mit conditions, the public security org@@ ans shall issue a resid@@ ence per@@ mit within 15 days from the date of accep@@ t@@ ance.
for the time limit@@ , most of the region hold the same opinion with the national ver@@ sion. that is, to release the per@@ mit within 15 days.
He@@ bei clearly sti@@ pul@@ ates that for applic@@ ants who meet the conditions of application and have complete application docu@@ ments, the resid@@ ence police station shall issue a resid@@ ence per@@ mit within 3 working days from the date of accep@@ t@@ ance.
Jiang@@ xi clearly sti@@ pul@@ ates that for applic@@ ants who meet the conditions of application and have complete application docu@@ ments, the public security shall issue a resid@@ ence per@@ mit within 5 working days from the date of accep@@ t@@ ance.
in accordance with the "@@ resid@@ ence per@@ mit provision@@ al regul@@ ation@@ s," the above cities sti@@ pul@@ ate clearly that the cost of certificate production shall be ex@@ emp@@ ted in case of initial application of resid@@ ence per@@ m@@ it.
for example, Sic@@ hu@@ an required the local police stations or commission@@ ed community service ag@@ encies shall stric@@ tly en@@ force the approved fees and charges standard and resolu@@ tely pro@@ hi@@ bit over@@ -@@ rang@@ e, over@@ -@@ standard fees or ride fe@@ es.
it was found that on July 27, 2016, Ch@@ en Y@@ ang@@ xi@@ a, the former G@@ an@@ zhou City D@@ ing@@ nan County Party Secretary came to the Prov@@ in@@ cial Commission for Dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine In@@ spec@@ tion for re@@ porting and serving as director of the C@@ PC super@@ vision room (@@ dep@@ uty director@@ -@@ gener@@ al, one year@@ 's prob@@ ation perio@@ d@@ ).
the red wine at the din@@ ner was provided by Li You@@ c@@ ai while other costs were bor@@ ne by Li@@ u@@ .
Jiang@@ xi Prov@@ in@@ cial Commission for Dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine In@@ spec@@ tion inform@@ ed that Ch@@ en Y@@ ang@@ x@@ ia and Ch@@ eng Z@@ ili@@ ang, who organized and accepted dining inv@@ itation in private club@@ s, viol@@ ated the spirit of the central eight provisions and the Par@@ ty@@ 's discipl@@ ine.
last seas@@ on, Po@@ g@@ ba was pun@@ ished with two y@@ ellow card@@ s. he will be ban@@ ned automatically according to the rul@@ es.
although he has transferred back to the Premi@@ er@@ ship, the Foot@@ ball Association Ch@@ all@@ enge Cup (F@@ A C@@ up@@ ) still pass@@ es his acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ative suspension to F@@ A C@@ up.
in this way, on August 14, in the away games of fi@@ ghting against B@@ our@@ n@@ em@@ ou@@ th, Po@@ g@@ ba will watch a fight without helping any party. his first show after return to Manch@@ ester United will be extended to Sou@@ th@@ amp@@ ton@@ 's home game on August 20@@ .
as the No.@@ 12 new arrival of the first round in 2014, Sal@@ ic will offici@@ ally land on the N@@ B@@ A in the next seas@@ on, and join the Phil@@ adel@@ p@@ hia 7@@ 6@@ ers.
as a young European play@@ er, Sal@@ ic is not known to many f@@ ans. but I believe he impres@@ sed people with his performance in this Olympic Gam@@ es.
in a game with win by a nar@@ row mar@@ gin of Croati@@ an over Spain, Sal@@ ic@@ i successfully bloc@@ ked Paul - G@@ as@@ ol in his last moment and tried to dra@@ g the game into the over@@ time bas@@ ket attack@@ .
rec@@ ently, Bre@@ t@@ t-@@ Brow@@ n, the command@@ er-@@ in-@@ chief of the 7@@ 6-@@ team gave Sal@@ ic a high rat@@ ing. he thought he saw the shad@@ ow of young Man@@ u@@ -@@ G@@ in@@ ob@@ il@@ i in Sar@@ ic.
it is quite ob@@ vious that Sar@@ ic already showed his gi@@ ft and made 7@@ 6 people full of expect@@ ations.
in Croati@@ a's first two games of the Olympic Gam@@ es, Sal@@ ic received a total of 24 poin@@ ts, 17 re@@ b@@ ounds and 12 assist@@ s.
in the first hal@@ f, Sal@@ ic showed his cap@@ ability of drawing space on the scen@@ e. he can have a shot outside the three-@@ point line via the pick and roll with his col@@ leagu@@ es.
although the current 7@@ 6-@@ team is pack@@ ed with many gif@@ ted young play@@ ers, they are not equipped with the outside sc@@ oring cap@@ ability as Sal@@ ic.
from block shot to laun@@ ching a long pas@@ s, fast break and complete assist@@ s, there are just a few in@@ sid@@ ers who can do it on the N@@ B@@ A game.
since the beginning of this Olympic Gam@@ es, Sal@@ ic has obtained 13 poin@@ ts, eight back@@ bo@@ ards and five assi@@ sts in three gam@@ es, with a full performance.
James has signed two 1 + 1 contrac@@ ts since he decided to return to the C@@ av@@ ali@@ ers in the summer of 201@@ 4.
now, as this labor agreement is about to enter the last year, James will be in the fore@@ front of labor negoti@@ ations as the v@@ ice ch@@ air@@ man of N@@ B@@ A player un@@ ion.
the substanti@@ al increase in union re@@ venue is attribu@@ ted to the new television proto@@ col@@ . the question is how the bo@@ ss and players deal with the money. the outside world is wor@@ ri@@ ed that the N@@ B@@ A will fall in the next sum@@ mer@@ .
but for Jam@@ es, he will not have to wor@@ ry that he will become a free agent next summer because he has renew@@ ed a 3-@@ year contract with the C@@ av@@ ali@@ ers.
no matter when the 201@@ 7-@@ 18 season k@@ ic@@ ks off, James is within the contrac@@ t.
since the st@@ unning de@@ but of i@@ Ph@@ one@@ SE@@ , the mobile phone market also us@@ her@@ ed in a small screen machine bo@@ om@@ .
not long ago, N@@ ub@@ ia also launched the first works of its Z@@ 11 seri@@ es: n@@ ub@@ i@@ a@@ Z@@ 11@@ mini@@ .
N@@ ub@@ i@@ a@@ Z@@ 11@@ mini follow@@ s its consistent photograph@@ ed gen@@ e, and is equipped with a one-@@ hand easi@@ er-@@ to-@@ hold 5.@@ 0-@@ inch screen, port@@ able and convenient post@@ -@@ fing@@ er@@ print recogni@@ tion, contribu@@ ting to its superior experience.
a small screen camera phone Z@@ 11@@ min@@ i, which was just listed by N@@ ub@@ ia, had a price fall of R@@ MB 200@@ , dec@@ reas@@ ing from the original R@@ MB 14@@ 99 to R@@ MB 12@@ 99@@ .
in appear@@ ance, n@@ ub@@ i@@ a@@ Z@@ 11@@ mini uses a 5-@@ inch 10@@ 80@@ p screen. the classic "@@ little red cir@@ cle@@ " design is below on the front side.
the middle frame is metal materi@@ al. its bottom adop@@ ts sym@@ met@@ r@@ ical design and is equipped with Ty@@ pe@@ -@@ C data inter@@ face.
Port@@ land sm@@ el@@ ter@@ 's future in doubt with ax@@ ing of power contract
the future of the Port@@ land alumin@@ ium sm@@ el@@ ter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclo@@ sing one of the pl@@ ant@@ 's owners is to terminate a supply contrac@@ t, with all supply contrac@@ ts expected to be ax@@ ed.
the move follow@@ s the decision of the Victoria government earlier this year to not exten@@ d subsidi@@ es provided to keep the plant in oper@@ ation.
a 20@@ -@@ year fixed sub@@ sid@@ y expi@@ res in Nov@@ emb@@ er.
up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Al@@ co@@ a's Port@@ land plan@@ t.
as many as 2000 jobs - direct and in@@ direct - could be at risk with any clo@@ su@@ re.
and there could be additional kno@@ c@@ k-@@ on effects since the sm@@ el@@ ter consum@@ es around 10 per cent of Victor@@ i@@ a's entire electricity out@@ put@@ .
in 2014, Al@@ co@@ a closed the Point Hen@@ ry sm@@ el@@ ter which led to the clo@@ sure last year of the An@@ gl@@ es@@ e@@ a power plan@@ t.
Al@@ co@@ a's Port@@ land sm@@ el@@ ter is lo@@ sing money and risks clo@@ su@@ re.
the mo@@ ves follow@@ s spec@@ ulation about the future of the plant for several years now, initi@@ ally in the wa@@ ke of the strong Australian dol@@ lar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plan@@ t.
AG@@ L@@ , which supplies the big alumin@@ ium sm@@ el@@ ter with electricity from its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in the La@@ Tro@@ be Val@@ le@@ y, said it exp@@ ects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agre@@ e@@ ments.
the plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Al@@ co@@ a and Al@@ umin@@ a, with China's CI@@ TI@@ C and Japan@@ 's Mar@@ ub@@ en@@ i Cor@@ p holding smaller sha@@ res.
"@@ AG@@ L exp@@ ects the Port@@ land facility to continue to oper@@ ate, meaning physical demand for electricity from the sm@@ el@@ ter will continu@@ e@@ ," it said.
AG@@ L said the contrac@@ ts are so@@ -@@ called '@@ h@@ ed@@ g@@ ing contrac@@ t@@ s' which were due to take effect from November 201@@ 6.
the contrac@@ ts have a 12-@@ month termination period so they will actually fin@@ ish in 201@@ 7.
"@@ as su@@ ch, AG@@ L continues to expect the contrac@@ ts to contribu@@ te to ear@@ n@@ ings in fiscal year 17@@ ," the power company said.
any potential ear@@ n@@ ings impact on AG@@ L from F@@ Y@@ 18 on@@ wards is currently limited by the strong fut@@ ures market out@@ look for wh@@ oles@@ ale electricity pric@@ es.
AG@@ L said it had already written down the value of the contrac@@ ts in its accoun@@ ts by $@@ 18@@ 7 million in "@@ an@@ ticip@@ ation of a termination event@@ ."
Al@@ co@@ a said the decision to close out the contrac@@ ts "@@ does not affect Al@@ co@@ a@@ '@@ s@@ ... ability to operate the sm@@ el@@ ter or secure electricity supply to the sm@@ el@@ ter@@ ."
the US company said it entered into a 20@@ -@@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang in 201@@ 0, which was due to commen@@ ce from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contrac@@ t.
analy@@ sts have been w@@ ary of the possible clo@@ sure of both of the Port@@ land sm@@ el@@ ter in Victoria and also the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ cast@@ le due to the poor econom@@ ics of the industry.
addres@@ sing analy@@ sts earlier in the wee@@ k, AG@@ L@@ 's head of oper@@ ations, Ste@@ ph@@ en Mi@@ k@@ k@@ el@@ sen said Port@@ land uses around 600 me@@ g@@ aw@@ at@@ ts of power ann@@ ually and Tom@@ ago around 9@@ 00 me@@ g@@ aw@@ at@@ ts.
if both of those plants go from the market that's a significant reduction in demand in the [@@ electric@@ ity@@ ] market.
and as a generator that w@@ ouldn't be good for us, "@@ he said.
community legal cent@@ res turn away 160@@ ,000 people a year
more than 160@@ ,000 of the nation@@ 's most vulner@@ able are turned away from community legal cent@@ res every year, with the sector br@@ acing itself for the impact further fun@@ ding cu@@ ts will have on al@@ read@@ y-@@ stret@@ ched oper@@ ations.
in Que@@ ens@@ land, three out of five people - mostly the el@@ der@@ ly, im@@ migr@@ ants, vulner@@ able work@@ ers, vic@@ tim@@ s of violence and those without resources to fight un@@ fair ev@@ ic@@ tions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and represent@@ ation.
community legal services, already stret@@ ched beyond limit@@ s, are br@@ acing for further cut@@ s.
from June next year, those legal cent@@ res are sl@@ ated to lose another 30 per cent of their fed@@ eral fun@@ d@@ ing.
Director of Community Legal Cent@@ res Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said the latest National Association of Community Legal Cent@@ res C@@ ensu@@ s Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year.
Mr Far@@ rel@@ l said without a re@@ vers@@ al of the fed@@ eral government decis@@ ion, the situation was only going to get wor@@ se.
"@@ Que@@ ens@@ land@@ 's community legal cent@@ res are chron@@ ically under@@ fun@@ d@@ ed, meaning thousands of people are turned away from the v@@ ital services they need@@ ," he said.
people leaving viol@@ ent relation@@ ship@@ s, people with un@@ manag@@ e@@ able and crip@@ pl@@ ing deb@@ ts, families going through separ@@ ation, workers who are un@@ fair@@ ly s@@ ack@@ ed - all of these people have problems with legal dimension@@ s, and this report shows that they're not able to get the help they need.
the fed@@ eral government will cut fun@@ ding by 30 per cent from June 201@@ 7, which means thousands more vulner@@ able Que@@ ens@@ land@@ ers will be forced to navig@@ ate complex legal problems without hel@@ p.
we call on the At@@ tor@@ ne@@ y-@@ Gener@@ al, and Que@@ ens@@ land Sen@@ ator George Br@@ and@@ is to immediately reverse these fun@@ ding cut@@ s, so people can get the help they need when they're fac@@ ed with a legal problem.
last year, the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid fun@@ ding up to the national a@@ ver@@ age.
it's now time to look at the needs of community legal cent@@ res and their client comm@@ uni@@ ties, and for the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ z@@ uk government to inv@@ est in this important work.
Don@@ ald Tr@@ ump campa@@ ign su@@ ed after staff@@ er alleg@@ ed@@ ly pulled a gun
new Yor@@ k@@ : Don@@ ald Tr@@ ump@@ 's campa@@ ign was su@@ ed for alleg@@ ed@@ ly doing nothing after being told that the director of its North Carol@@ ina operations pulled a gun on a staff@@ er as they dro@@ ve in a Je@@ ep in Febr@@ u@@ ary.
the incid@@ ent was described in a law@@ suit filed on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day in state court in Char@@ lot@@ te by V@@ inc@@ ent B@@ ordin@@ i, a former software train@@ er for the state campaign@@ .
B@@ ordin@@ i said he wai@@ ted for months for the situation to be hand@@ led inter@@ n@@ ally before real@@ ising "@@ this was not going to happen@@ ."
the direc@@ tor, Ear@@ l Phil@@ li@@ p, "@@ produced a p@@ ist@@ ol, put his right index fing@@ er on the trigg@@ er, and dro@@ ve the bar@@ re@@ l into V@@ inc@@ ent@@ 's kne@@ e cap@@ ," B@@ ordin@@ i said in the complain@@ t.
after complain@@ ing to local and regional campa@@ ign lead@@ er@@ ship, B@@ ordin@@ i learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with Phil@@ li@@ p, according to the fil@@ ing.
"@@ gun@@ s don't have to fire to in@@ flic@@ t dam@@ age@@ ," B@@ ordin@@ i said in the complain@@ t.
the suit comes just two days after the Republic@@ an presid@@ ential nom@@ ine@@ e caused a fur@@ ore when telling a crow@@ d in North Carol@@ ina that the "@@ Second A@@ mend@@ ment people@@ " -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusi@@ asts -- could take action if his riv@@ al Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ton were elec@@ ted and gets her pick of judg@@ es.
Tr@@ ump@@ 's campa@@ ign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn't advoc@@ ating viol@@ ence.

Brit@@ ain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will also deliver re@@ generation and pro@@ sper@@ ity not just in our local communities and across London, but across the country.
for me, this was the great attrac@@ tion of He@@ ath@@ row@@ , just as it was with London 201@@ 2, where we made en@@ or@@ m@@ ous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions bene@@ fi@@ ted from the Gam@@ es.
the Olymp@@ ics achieved huge benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East En@@ d.
and, we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and fir@@ ms close to He@@ ath@@ row@@ .
for our local communities alone we'll create 10@@ ,000 new app@@ ren@@ tic@@ es@@ hi@@ ps, 40@@ ,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth un@@ employment around the air@@ port.
just as there were ahead of London 201@@ 2, there will be those that think the challenge of He@@ ath@@ row expansion is too gre@@ at.
I was told that Brit@@ ain would be never be ready for the Games and that we would be embar@@ r@@ ass@@ ed on the world st@@ age.
the dou@@ b@@ ters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on He@@ ath@@ row@@ .
there are always ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les to be over@@ come, but He@@ ath@@ row is answ@@ ering every question asked of it.
like the Olymp@@ ics, He@@ ath@@ row is an infrastructure project for the man@@ y, not just the fe@@ w@@ .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180@@ ,000 new job@@ s, £@@ 2@@ 11@@ b@@ n in economic grow@@ th, leaving a leg@@ acy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK@@ .
we have a great team at He@@ ath@@ row who have imple@@ mented an £@@ 11@@ b@@ n programme of infrastructure investment on time and on bud@@ get@@ , from T@@ 5 - vo@@ ted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row@@ , to T@@ 2, built in the middle of the world's b@@ usi@@ est two run@@ way@@ s.
now they stand ready to deliver a third run@@ way, back@@ ed by £@@ 16 billion of private invest@@ ment.
the London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confid@@ ent that He@@ ath@@ row expansion will be too.
it is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row@@ , sec@@ uring our trading future and creating a leg@@ acy of skills and employment that Brit@@ ain can be proud of@@ .

woman run over on Swiss motor@@ way in app@@ aren@@ t su@@ ic@@ ide
the vic@@ ti@@ m was lying on the motor@@ way in the middle of the night.
police are appe@@ aling for wit@@ ness@@ es after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motor@@ way in the early hours of Th@@ urs@@ day in an app@@ aren@@ t act of su@@ ic@@ id@@ e.
the incid@@ ent happened on the A@@ 1 near Mor@@ ges in the c@@ ant@@ on of V@@ au@@ d just after mid@@ night on Th@@ urs@@ day.
a woman lay down in the dark on the road "@@ in a des@@ per@@ ate act@@ " and was hit by several vehic@@ les, V@@ au@@ d police said in a state@@ ment.
clearly looking to kill her@@ self, the vic@@ tim@@ , a Swiss woman aged 4@@ 9, was hit by several vehicles including a lor@@ ry.
she died at the scen@@ e.
several of the drivers involved have already been inter@@ viewed but some are still un@@ identifi@@ ed, said polic@@ e, who are calling for them and anyone else who wit@@ ness@@ ed the incid@@ ent to come for@@ w@@ ard.
a criminal investig@@ ation has been open@@ ed, a "@@ log@@ ic@@ al@@ " step in a situation like this, law@@ yer G@@ ill@@ es Ho@@ f@@ ste@@ t@@ ter told Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Genev@@ e.
howe@@ ver it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charg@@ es.
was it possible to avoid imp@@ act@@ ?
that's what the pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ or must determin@@ e, "@@ said Ho@@ f@@ ste@@ t@@ ter.
two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsi@@ ble.
in each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motor@@ way in the dark - it was judg@@ ed that motor@@ ists cannot expect to come across a ped@@ est@@ ri@@ an on the motor@@ way in the middle of the night, said the pap@@ er.
last year a police offic@@ er was acqu@@ it@@ ted of ca@@ using death by neg@@ lig@@ ence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A@@ 1 near Pay@@ ner@@ ne one night in August 201@@ 4.
the 2@@ 2-@@ year-@@ old vic@@ ti@@ m had been drin@@ king and had passed out on the ro@@ ad, the court he@@ ard.
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ om@@ an -- who was respon@@ ding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was jus@@ tified and that the presence of a man on the road was a "@@ completely exceptional and un@@ predic@@ table situ@@ ation@@ ," the jud@@ ge said.

N@@ AS@@ A climate mod@@ el@@ : Ven@@ us was once hab@@ itable
Ven@@ us was likely once habit@@ able, according to the projec@@ tions of a new N@@ AS@@ A climate mod@@ el.
scienti@@ sts at N@@ AS@@ A@@ 's God@@ d@@ ard Institute for Space Studi@@ es developed a model to explore Ven@@ us@@ ' past using tools and algorith@@ ms similar to those emplo@@ yed by climate scienti@@ st@@ s.
the model was designed to determine whether or not Ven@@ us, with its ho@@ t, wat@@ er-@@ less surface and CO@@ 2-@@ ch@@ oc@@ ked atmosp@@ here, might have once hos@@ ted Ear@@ th-@@ like conditions.
scienti@@ sts have previously sugg@@ ested that Ven@@ us@@ ' s@@ low rot@@ ation rate is expl@@ ained by its th@@ ick atmosp@@ here.
but the latest simul@@ ation sugg@@ ests Ven@@ us could have bo@@ as@@ ted a th@@ in, Ear@@ th-@@ like atmosphere and still sp@@ un slow@@ ly.
the model also looked at the top@@ ography of early Ven@@ us.
the plan@@ et likely feat@@ ured more dry regions than Ear@@ th, but once had enough water and ge@@ ograph@@ ical vari@@ ability to host life and guard against rapid ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ation.
early Ven@@ us also bene@@ fi@@ ted from a sun that was 30 percent di@@ m@@ mer@@ .
"@@ in the G@@ IS@@ S mod@@ el@@ 's simul@@ ation, Ven@@ us@@ ' s@@ low sp@@ in expos@@ es its day@@ side to the sun for almost two months at a time@@ ," G@@ IS@@ S scienti@@ st An@@ th@@ ony D@@ el G@@ eni@@ o expl@@ ained in a news rele@@ as@@ e.
this war@@ ms the surface and produc@@ es rain that creates a th@@ ick layer of clou@@ ds, which acts like an umb@@ rel@@ la to shi@@ eld the surface from much of the solar he@@ ating.
the result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degre@@ es cool@@ er than Ear@@ th@@ 's today.
the model produced a story of Ven@@ us similar to the ev@@ olution previously hypo@@ thes@@ ized by plan@@ etary scienti@@ st@@ s.
though likely once habit@@ able, Ven@@ us was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ul@@ trav@@ i@@ o@@ let light.
its oce@@ ans ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ated and its water v@@ ap@@ or was bur@@ ned away by ul@@ trav@@ i@@ o@@ let light.
as its hydro@@ gen escap@@ ed, all that was left was a th@@ ick atmosphere of carbon di@@ ox@@ ide with a death@@ ly gre@@ en@@ house gas effect -- th@@ us, the Ven@@ us we know today.
research@@ ers shared the results of their new Ven@@ us climate model in the jour@@ nal Ge@@ oph@@ ys@@ ical Research Let@@ ters.
Pat@@ r@@ ick Ro@@ y re@@ signs as A@@ val@@ anch@@ e co@@ ach
Pat@@ r@@ ick Ro@@ y re@@ signed as co@@ ach and v@@ ice president of the ho@@ c@@ key operations of the Color@@ ado A@@ val@@ anch@@ e on Th@@ urs@@ day, c@@ iting a lack of a voice within the team@@ 's decision@@ -@@ making process.
Color@@ ado executive v@@ ice president / general manager Jo@@ e S@@ ak@@ ic confirm@@ ed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new co@@ ach immedi@@ ately.
"@@ for the past three years, I have carried out my du@@ ties as head co@@ ach and v@@ ice president of ho@@ c@@ key operations for the Color@@ ado A@@ val@@ anch@@ e with energ@@ y, pas@@ sion and determin@@ ation@@ ," the 50@@ -@@ year-@@ old Ro@@ y said in the state@@ ment.
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.
to achieve this, the vision of the co@@ ach and VP@@ -@@ ho@@ c@@ key operations needs to be perfectly al@@ igned with that of the organiz@@ ation.
he must also have a say in the decis@@ ions that impact the team@@ 's performance.
these conditions are not currently met@@ .

North Sea oil workers res@@ ume tal@@ ks, suspend stri@@ ke
labor stri@@ kes over pay for North Sea oil workers are susp@@ ended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of tal@@ ks, lead negoti@@ ators said.
stri@@ kes against o@@ il@@ field services company W@@ ood Group have been st@@ aged s@@ por@@ ad@@ ically on plat@@ forms in the North Sea operated by Royal D@@ ut@@ ch Sh@@ ell@@ .
"@@ wood Group and the Un@@ ite and R@@ M@@ T un@@ ions can confirm we have agreed to rest@@ art the process for resolution of the current dispu@@ te@@ ," a joint statement read@@ .
we will hold a number of full-@@ day meet@@ ings over the next few wee@@ ks, starting early next wee@@ k, to take a fresh look at the issu@@ es.
the labor un@@ ions said their recent action, which they said is the first in more than 25 years, was in pro@@ test of potential pay cu@@ ts of up to 30 percent@@ .
wood Group this year cut rates paid to its North Sea contrac@@ tors by about 9 percent because of negative market pressu@@ res.
the company's rate reduction follow@@ s a 10 percent decre@@ ase for on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 201@@ 4.
the company said additional cu@@ ts would give the company the room needed to move through the market down@@ tur@@ n.
sh@@ ell, for its par@@ t, has tri@@ m@@ med thousands of people from its pay@@ roll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its operations in the wa@@ ke of its me@@ g@@ a-@@ mer@@ ger with British energy company B@@ G Grou@@ p.
energy companies are under pressure from lower cr@@ ude oil prices, an economic situation comp@@ ounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Uni@@ on.
Scot@@ tish Member of Par@@ li@@ ament D@@ ave An@@ der@@ son met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to stri@@ ke the North Sea in a gener@@ ation.
the North Se@@ a, he said, is v@@ ital for the regional econom@@ y.
"@@ in the North Sea and right across the country, we need an economy that works for the many and not just the fe@@ w@@ ," he said in a state@@ ment.
less than $@@ 1.@@ 4 billion in sp@@ ending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared with an average of around $@@ 7 billion in the past five years.
Ke@@ pl@@ er measures sp@@ in rates of stars in Ple@@ i@@ ades cl@@ us@@ ter
the latest mission by the Ke@@ pl@@ er space tel@@ es@@ cop@@ e has helped astr@@ onom@@ ers collect the most complete cat@@ alog of sp@@ in rates among the stars of the Ple@@ i@@ ades cl@@ ust@@ er.
the new data is helping astr@@ onom@@ ers understand why stars in the cl@@ us@@ ter sp@@ in at var@@ ying r@@ ates, as well as how rot@@ ation perio@@ ds rel@@ ate to plan@@ et form@@ ation.
"@@ we hope that by compar@@ ing our results to other star cl@@ ust@@ ers, we will learn more about the relationship between a star@@ 's mas@@ s, its age, and even the history of its solar system@@ ," Lu@@ is@@ a Re@@ bul@@ l, a research scienti@@ st at Cal@@ tech@@ 's In@@ fr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ en@@ a, said in a news rele@@ as@@ e.
the Ple@@ i@@ ades cl@@ us@@ ter is situated 4@@ 45 ligh@@ t-@@ years from Ear@@ th.
many of the stars in the cl@@ us@@ ter are just now re@@ aching ad@@ ul@@ th@@ oo@@ d, having been born rou@@ gh@@ ly 12@@ 5 million years ag@@ o.
they're sp@@ in@@ ning as fast as they ever will@@ .
at their pe@@ ak sp@@ in r@@ ates, these mat@@ uring stars e@@ ject large amoun@@ ts of s@@ tel@@ lar wind@@ .
as these wind@@ s travel across the star@@ s' magnetic fiel@@ ds, they en@@ act a bra@@ king effect on the star@@ s.
as a star ages, its sp@@ in rate begins to s@@ low down.
Ke@@ pl@@ er measures each star@@ 's sp@@ in rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recogni@@ z@@ able star@@ spo@@ ts -- like sun@@ spo@@ ts.
the latest cat@@ alog of sp@@ in rates sugg@@ ests more mas@@ sive stars sp@@ in more slowly than less mas@@ sive star@@ s.
Re@@ bul@@ l lik@@ ens the stars to d@@ anc@@ ers, larger ones p@@ ir@@ ou@@ et@@ ting more slowly than smaller on@@ es.
"@@ in the '@@ bal@@ let@@ ' of the Ple@@ i@@ ad@@ es, we see that s@@ low rot@@ ators tend to be more m@@ assi@@ ve, where@@ as the fas@@ test rot@@ ators tend to be very light star@@ s," said Re@@ bul@@ l.
because the Ple@@ i@@ ades cl@@ us@@ ter is so clo@@ se, it serves as an ideal co@@ sm@@ ic laboratory to compare s@@ tel@@ lar quali@@ ties with sp@@ in rates.
"the Ple@@ i@@ ades star cl@@ us@@ ter provides an anch@@ or for the@@ ore@@ tical models of s@@ tel@@ lar rot@@ ation going both direc@@ tions, youn@@ ger and ol@@ der@@ ," said Re@@ bul@@ l.
we still have a lot we want to learn about ho@@ w, when and why stars s@@ low their sp@@ in rates and h@@ ang up their '@@ dance sho@@ es@@ ,@@ ' so to speak@@ .
Re@@ bul@@ l and her col@@ leagu@@ es detailed their latest analysis of Ple@@ i@@ ades sp@@ in rates in three new pap@@ ers, soon to be published in the A@@ str@@ onom@@ ical Jour@@ n@@ al.
according to Z@@ heng Ji@@ anj@@ un@@ , the Management Section Chief of N@@ an@@ h@@ u Park Water Area, the deep@@ est point of the South Lake is more than 10 meters deep@@ . people who do not understand the situation of water are probably con@@ fron@@ ted with dang@@ er.
"@@ although the N@@ an@@ h@@ u Park res@@ c@@ ue team is very profession@@ al, we still hope that the majority of row@@ ing tou@@ rists can wear life jack@@ ets and stay away from illegal activities on the la@@ ke to play saf@@ el@@ y" Z@@ heng Ji@@ anj@@ un said.
W@@ ai Ta@@ u T@@ su@@ en boasts a unique mar@@ ine environment, with two leisure travel resources including natural ec@@ ology and cultural ec@@ olog@@ y.
"@@ however, several owners who bought the parking sp@@ aces in the community fe@@ ared that this would affect the price of their parking sp@@ aces and dou@@ b@@ ted that others were self@@ ish, so they had been p@@ lot@@ ting for bad things. this had shel@@ ved the parking space transform@@ ation@@ ."
as for the question about when the sweet pot@@ ato@@ es are introduced and by wh@@ om, there are still many different versions in the academic commun@@ ity.
in the current main@@ stream view, there are three major lines for the introduction of sweet pot@@ at@@ o.
among the three lines of introduc@@ ing sweet pot@@ at@@ o, the introduction by Ch@@ en Z@@ hen@@ long from Philipp@@ ine to Fu@@ zhou is the one with the greatest impact and largest communic@@ ation.
Beijing Munic@@ ip@@ al Social Management Office will soon carry out special inspec@@ tions on the use of uni@@ fied receip@@ ts of social group membership fe@@ es.
inspection is divided into two categori@@ es, unit self-@@ examination and spot inspec@@ tion.
relevant person in charge of the municip@@ al associ@@ ation said, the scope of the inspection covers social groups who received uni@@ fied receip@@ ts of social group fees in the social mass organization between 2013 and 201@@ 5.
"the success of the Olympic Games is defined by people who share stor@@ ies in social medi@@ a@@ ," said the Rio Olympic Organ@@ izing Committee while establish@@ ing the communication strategy of 2012 Olympic Gam@@ es.
from the news reports of the Olympic Gam@@ es, all media have made a lot of changes in the aspect of mode of trans@@ mis@@ sion, product form, language style, news perspec@@ tive and many other asp@@ ec@@ ts.
it seems that the International Olympic Committee and the media practi@@ tion@@ ers around the world will have to meet this round of challeng@@ es.
on August 11, this is the last day for the open sale of Ever@@ bright Secur@@ ities H sha@@ res. news went that the market response was not special for market of the previous two days. according to the pl@@ an, it will be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on August 18@@ .
a domestic bro@@ ker@@ age analy@@ st said that the Ori@@ ent Secur@@ ities in Hong Kong did not enjoy a good found@@ ation. only its capital management business is its streng@@ th. it has many inher@@ ent problems compared with Bank of China International and CI@@ TI@@ C Secur@@ ities, etc.
experts poin@@ ted out that with the return of the secur@@ ities market to fl@@ at@@ ness, many bro@@ kers s@@ agged this year in results. but the detailed situation of the listed companies is dependent on the detailed development of the corporate business and cannot be gener@@ aliz@@ ed.
after the introduction of the regul@@ ation of the new de@@ al, Su@@ zhou will become the first second@@ -@@ ti@@ er city to rest@@ art the purchase restric@@ tion.
in addition to Su@@ zhou, other second@@ -@@ ti@@ er cities including He@@ fe@@ i and N@@ anj@@ ing will also introduce the property market regul@@ ation and control polici@@ es.
prior to this, He@@ fe@@ i has been the first to issue restrictions on l@@ ending policy. for people who have two suites in He@@ fe@@ i and have one housing lo@@ an not pa@@ id, they will be d@@ eni@@ ed with the mort@@ g@@ age services from ban@@ k.
